 Cuisine of the Caribbean 
 "West Indian cuisine" redirects here. For cuisine of Western India, see  Western India § Cuisine . 
   Mangu with veggie meat 
 Caribbean  cuisine  is a fusion of  West African , [1]   Creole ,  Cajun ,  Amerindian ,  European ,  Latin American ,  Indian / South Asian ,  Middle Eastern , and  Chinese . These traditions were brought from many different countries when they came to the Caribbean. [1]  In addition, the population has created styles that are unique to the region.
 
 
 History [ edit ] 
 The Caribbean is a fusion of West African,  Amerindian ,  East Asian ,  Arab ,  South Asian ,  British ,  Spanish ,  Dutch  and  French  cuisines. In 1493, during the  voyages of Christopher Columbus , the  Spaniards  introduced a variety of ingredients, including  coconut ,  chickpeas ,  cilantro ,  eggplants ,  onions  and  garlic .
 
 Caribbean dishes [ edit ] 
 Further information:  List of street food § Caribbean 
   Dhalpurie  roti , pumpkin tarkari, channa and aloo, and  curry goat , from Trinidad and Tobago 
 Ingredients that are common in most islands' dishes are  rice ,  plantains ,  beans ,  cassava ,  cilantro ,  bell peppers ,  chickpeas ,  tomatoes ,  sweet potatoes ,  coconut , and any of various meats that are locally available like beef, poultry, pork or fish. A characteristic seasoning for the region is a green herb-and-oil-based marinade called sofrito, which imparts a flavor profile which is quintessentially Caribbean in character. Ingredients may include garlic, onions, scotch bonnet peppers, celery, green onions, and herbs like cilantro, Mexican mint, chives, marjoram, rosemary, tarragon and thyme. This green seasoning is used for a variety of dishes like curries, stews and roasted meats. [2] 
 Traditional dishes are so important to regional culture that, for example, the local version of Caribbean goat stew has been chosen as the official national dish of  Montserrat  and is also one of the signature dishes of  St. Kitts and Nevis . Another popular dish in the Anglophone Caribbean is called "cook-up", or  pelau .  Ackee and saltfish  is another popular dish that is unique to Jamaica.  Callaloo  is a dish containing leafy vegetables such as  spinach  and sometimes  okra  amongst others, widely distributed in the Caribbean, with a distinctively mixed African and indigenous character.
 The variety of dessert dishes in the area also reflects the mixed origins of the recipes. In some areas,  black cake , a derivative of English Christmas pudding, may be served, especially on special occasions.
 Over time, food from the Caribbean has evolved into a narrative technique through which their culture has been accentuated and promoted. However, by studying Caribbean culture through a literary lens there then runs the risk of generalizing exoticist ideas about food practices from the tropics. Some food theorists argue that this depiction of Caribbean food in various forms of media contributes to the inaccurate conceptions revolving around their culinary practices, which are much more grounded in unpleasant historical events. Therefore, it can be argued that the connection between the idea of the Caribbean being the ultimate paradise and Caribbean food being exotic is based on inaccurate information. [3]
