 Buddhist cuisine  is an  Asian   cuisine  that is followed by  monks  and many believers from areas historically influenced by  Mahayana Buddhism . It is vegetarian or vegan, and it is based on the Dharmic concept of  ahimsa  (non-violence). Vegetarianism is common in other Dharmic faiths such as  Hinduism ,  Jainism  and  Sikhism , as well as East Asian religions like  Taoism . While  monks ,  nuns  and a minority of  believers  are vegetarian year-round, many believers follow the Buddhist vegetarian diet for celebrations.
 The origin of "Buddhist food" as a distinct sub-style of cuisine is tied to  monasteries , where one member of the community would have the duty of being the head cook and supplying meals that paid respect to the strictures of  Buddhist precepts . Temples that were open to visitors from the general public might also serve meals to them and a few temples effectively run functioning restaurants on the premises. In Japan, this practice is generally known as  shōjin ryōri  ( 精進料理 , devotion cuisine) , and served at many temples, especially in  Kyoto . A more recent version, more Chinese in style, is prepared by the  Ōbaku  school of zen, and known as  fucha ryōri  ( 普茶料理 ) ; this is served at the head temple of  Manpuku-ji , as well as various subtemples. In modern times, commercial restaurants have also latched on to the style, catering both to practicing and non-practicing lay people.
 
 
 Philosophies governing food [ edit ] 
 Vegetarianism [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Buddhist vegetarianism 
 Most of the dishes considered to be uniquely Buddhist are vegetarian, but not all Buddhist traditions require vegetarianism of lay followers or clergy. [1]  Vegetarian eating is primarily associated with the East and Southeast Asian tradition in China, Vietnam, Japan, and Korea where it is commonly practiced by clergy and may be observed by laity on holidays or as a devotional practice. [2] 
 In the  Mahayana  tradition, several sutras of the  Mahayana canon  contain explicit prohibitions against consuming meat, including sections of the  Lankavatara Sutra  and  Surangama Sutra . The monastic community in Chinese Buddhism, Vietnamese Buddhism and most of Korean Buddhism strictly adhere to vegetarianism. [2] 
 Theravada  Buddhist monks and nuns consume food by gathering  alms  themselves, and generally must eat whatever foods are offered to them, including meat. [3]  The exception to this alms rule is when monks and nuns have seen, heard or known that animal(s) have been specifically killed to feed the alms-seeker, in which case consumption of such meat would be  karmically  negative, as well as meat from certain animals, such as dogs and snakes, that were regarded as impure in ancient India. [3] [4]  The same restriction is also followed by some  lay Buddhists  and is known as the consumption of "triply clean meat" (三净肉). The  Pāli Scriptures  also indicated that Lord Buddha refusing a proposal by his traitor disciple  Devadatta  to mandate vegetarianism in the monastic precepts.
 Tibetan Buddhism  has long accepted that the practical difficulties in obtaining vegetables and grains within most of Tibet make it impossible to insist upon vegetarianism; however, many leading Tibetan Buddhist teachers agree upon the great worth of practicing vegetarianism whenever and wherever possible, [5]  such as  Chatral Rinpoche , a lifelong advocate of vegetarianism who famously released large amounts of fish caught for food back into the ocean once a year, and who wrote about the practice of saving lives. [6] 
 Both  Mahayana  and  Theravada  Buddhists consider that one may practice vegetarianism as part of cultivating  Bodhisattvas's   paramita . [3] [2] 
 
 Other restrictions [ edit ] 
   Shōjin-ryōri served at  Mount Koya , Japan 
 In addition to the ban on  garlic , practically all  Mahayana  monastics in China, Korea, Vietnam and Japan specifically avoid eating strong-smelling plants, traditionally  asafoetida ,  shallot , mountain  leek  and  Allium chinense , which together with garlic are referred to as  wǔ hūn  (五葷, or 'Five Acrid and Strong-smelling Vegetables') or  wǔ xīn  (五辛 or 'Five Spices') as they tend to excite senses. This is based on teachings found in the  Brahamajala Sutra , the  Surangama Sutra  and the  Lankavatara Sutra  (chapter eight). In modern times this rule is often interpreted to include other vegetables of the  onion   genus , as well as  coriander . The origin of this additional restriction is from the Indic region and can still be found among some believers of  Hinduism  and  Jainism . Some Taoists also have this additional restriction but the list of restricted plants differs from the Buddhist list. [7] 
 The food that a strict Buddhist takes, if not a vegetarian, is also specific. For many Chinese Buddhists, beef and the consumption of large animals and exotic species is avoided. Then there would be the aforementioned "triply clean meat" rule. One restriction on food that is not known to many is the abstinence from eating animal  offal  (organ meat). This is known as  xiàshui  (下水), not to be confused with the term for sewage. [ citation needed ] 
 Alcohol and other drugs are also avoided by many Buddhists because of their effects on the mind and " mindfulness ". It is part of the  Five Precepts  which dictate that one is not to consume "addictive materials". The definition of "addictive" depends on each individual but most Buddhists consider alcohol,  tobacco  and drugs other than medicine to be addictive. [ citation needed ]  Although  caffeine  is now also known to be addictive, caffeinated drinks and especially  tea  are not included under this restriction; tea in particular is considered to be healthful and beneficial and its mild stimulant effect desirable. There are many legends about tea.  Among meditators it is considered to keep the person alert and awake without overexcitement.
 
 Simple and natural [ edit ] 
 In theory and practice, many regional styles of cooking may be adapted to be "Buddhist" as long as the cook, with the above restrictions in mind, prepares the food, generally in simple preparations, with expert attention to its quality, wholesomeness and flavor. Often working on a tight budget, the monastery cook would have to make the most of whatever ingredients were available.
 In  Tenzo kyokun  ("Instructions for the Zen Cook"),  Soto Zen  founder  Eihei Dogen  wrote the following about the Zen attitude toward food:
 
 In preparing food, it is essential to be sincere and to respect each ingredient regardless of how coarse or fine it is. (...) A rich buttery soup is not better as such than a broth of wild herbs. In handling and preparing wild herbs, do so as you would the ingredients for a rich feast, wholeheartedly, sincerely, clearly. When you serve the monastic assembly, they and you should taste only the flavour of the Ocean of Reality, the Ocean of unobscured Awake Awareness, not whether or not the soup is creamy or made only of wild herbs. In nourishing the seeds of living in the Way, rich food and wild grass are not separate. [8]

 Following its dominant status in most parts of East Asia where Buddhism is most practiced,  rice  features heavily as a staple in the Buddhist meal, especially in the form of rice porridge or  congee  as the usual morning meal.  Noodles  and other grains may often be served as well.  Vegetables of all sorts are generally either stir-fried or cooked in vegetarian broth with seasonings and may be eaten with various sauces. Traditionally eggs and dairy are not permitted. Seasonings will be informed by whatever is common in the local region; for example,  soy sauce  and vegan  dashi  figure strongly in Japanese monastery food while  curry  and  Tương  (as a vegetarian replacement for fish sauce) may be prominent in Southeast Asia. Sweets and desserts are not often consumed, but are permitted in moderation and may be served at special occasions such as in the context of a  tea ceremony  in the Zen tradition.
 Buddhist vegetarian chefs have become extremely creative in imitating meat using prepared  wheat gluten , also known as seitan, kao fu (烤麸) or wheat meat,  soy  (such as  tofu  or  tempeh ),  agar ,  konnyaku  and other  plant  products.  Some of their recipes are the oldest and most-refined  meat analogues  in the world.  Soy and wheat gluten are very versatile materials, because they can be manufactured into various shapes and textures, and they absorb flavorings (including, but not limited to, meat-like flavorings), while having very little flavor of their own.  With the proper  seasonings , they can mimic various kinds of meat quite closely.
 Some of these Buddhist vegetarian chefs are in the many  monasteries  and  temples  which serve allium-free and mock-meat (also known as 'meat analogues') dishes to the monks and visitors (including non-Buddhists who often stay for a few hours or days, to Buddhists who are not monks, but staying overnight for anywhere up to weeks or months). Many Buddhist restaurants also serve vegetarian, vegan, non-alcoholic or allium-free dishes.
 Some Buddhists eat vegetarian on the 1st and 15th of the lunar calendar (lenten days), on Chinese New Year eve, and on saint and ancestral holy days.  To cater to this type of customer, as well as full-time vegetarians, the menu of a Buddhist vegetarian restaurant usually shows no difference from a typical Chinese or East Asian restaurant, except that in recipes originally made to contain meat, a soy chicken substitute might be served instead.
 
 Variations by sect or region [ edit ] 
 According to cookbooks published in English, formal monastery meals in the  Zen  tradition generally follow a pattern of  "three bowls"  in descending size. The first and largest bowl is a grain-based dish such as rice, noodles or  congee ; the second contains the protein dish which is often some form of stew or soup; the third and smallest bowl is a vegetable dish or a salad. [9]
