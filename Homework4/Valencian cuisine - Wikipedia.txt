 Cuisine from the Valencian Community 
   Oranges , typical fruit from  Valencian Community 
 Valencian cuisine  is a  Mediterranean cuisine  as cooked in the  Valencian Community ,  Spain . Its basic ingredients are  vegetables ,  seafood  and  meat . It is famous worldwide for its  rices , such as  paella , and its  citrus  fruits. The cuisine of neighbouring regions have given and received important contributions from  Valencian gastronomy , amongst them  Balearic cuisine ,  Catalan cuisine ,  Aragonese cuisine ,  Manchego cuisine  and Murcian cuisine.
 
 
 Main dishes [ edit ] 
   A Valencian  Paella 
   Fideuà 
   Allioli  sauce 
 Paella . The most famous Valencian dish is one of the most recent. Although many towns claim to be the birthplace of paella, it is usually considered native to  Albufera  and Ribera, just south of Valencia. It can be found in two main varieties, with chicken and rabbit or with seafood. Nowadays paella can be found around the world and especially throughout Spain and Latin America. The name comes from the large pan ('paella' in Valencian) where it is cooked. 
 Arròs negre . Rice with squid and squid ink cooked in a paella. 
 Arròs amb conill i caragols. Rice dish with rabbit and snails, amongst other ingredients cooked in a paella. It is typical of the south of Valencia and especially in the  Vinalopo  districts. 
 Arròs al forn. A rice dish baked in the oven and usually containing sausages, chickpeas and potato amongst other ingredients, usually made with the surplus of the local typical  stew . 
 Fideuà . A dish based on noodles and seafood, typical of the Valencian coast and originally from Gandia. 
 Arròs amb costra A kind of  arròs al forn  but covered with an  egg  which provides the "crust" in the name. It is typical of most of the south of Valencia and especially of  Elche . 
 Gazpacho . A famous Spanish dish typical throughout south and central Spain. In the Valencia region it is typical of the southern and inland areas and is the quintessential summer dish. 
 Arròs a banda . A humble preparation typical of the Valencian coast with rice,  fish , and garlic. 
 Embotits . Cured sausages. 
 Sobrassada  a typically Majorcan meat-product which is produced in the Marina. 
 Bollit. Vegetable stew. 
 Suquet de peix. An eel, potato, garlic and fish stew, similar to  Bouillabaisse . 
 All i pebre. a signature dish for the area around Valencia city and immediately to the south, containing peppers, garlic and potatoes with  eels . 
 Esgarrat  or  Pericana  in the mountains of  Alcoi . It is a mixture of roasted peppers and strips of salted cod. The pericana also adds garlic. 
 Espencat. Roasted vegetables, typically peppers and aubergine but other vegetables can be added. 
 Coques . Ancient local salty pastries with a common origin with Italian Pizza. 
 Sauces [ edit ] 
 Allioli . This is a thick sauce, common to most of the Western Mediterranean, based on mixing  garlic  and olive oil to which egg is sometimes added. It usually has a characteristic yellow colour. 
 Mullador. A sauce whose ingredients may vary but always includes tomatoes. The remaining ingredients depend on the time of year and the vegetables available in each area. There are similar preparations throughout the Mediterranean. Other names for this kind of sauce are "samfaina" in Catalonia, "tomacat" or "tombet" in Majorca and  ratatouille  in France; much simpler is the "salsa napoletana" in Italy. In Alcoi and further south, this sauce may include tuna as is the case with "pisto", typical of Castile la Mancha. 
 Picada . This is a sauce composed of crushed nuts - usually almonds - olive oil, parsley and a little milk. It usually accompanies fish dishes. 
 Sweets, apéritifs, desserts and drinks [ edit ] 
   Pumpkin   Bunyols  (Bunyols de carabassa) 
   Orxata  and  fartons 
   Mistelle  glass 
 Pestinyos. A small, sweet and dry pastry folded into three and flavoured with orange and aniseed. 
 Pastissets , a typical sweet made of pastry with a sweet almond or sweet potato filling. It is of probable Arab origin and is typical of most of Valencia and the south of Catalonia. A similar dish, called  rubiols , is typical in Majorca. 
 Arnadí typical of  Xàtiva 
 Coca (pastry) . A kind of pizza or pie which can be either sweet or savoury. It is typical to most of Valencia as well as in some parts of  Catalonia .  The most common kinds in Valencia are the  coca de llanda , a kind of sponge-cake, often pumpkin-, lemon- or apple-flavoured;  coca de mullador  - or  coca de Sant Joan  in Alicante - a small pizza-like pastry with ratatouille on top and occasionally tuna or other titbits; and  coca de xulla , a flat bread with bacon and sausages on top. "Coca de molletes" typical of Alicante with soft salty flour crumbles. 
 Coques de dacsa, originally from  Ròtova  near  Gandia  and commercially available in the area around Denia and Gandia. These are flat pastry bases similar to Mexican  tortillas , and topped with various titbits such as  mullador . A similar preparation are coques de mestall, from the neighbouring county  Valldigna . 
 Arrop i tallaetes. A dessert which immerses fruit pieces in a sweet syrup made from grape  must . 
 Fartons . These are pastry fingers designed to be dipped in  orxata . 
 Orxata ( Horchata ). A drink made from submerging rice or other products in water for long periods. There are at least two kinds made locally. The first is  Orxata de  Xufa , made with tigernuts, quintessentially Valencian and produced only in the area of  Alboraya , just north of Valencia. The second is  Orxata d' Ametlla , made and consumed in the  Alicante  and  Xixona . 
 Peladillas ( Jordan almonds ). Typical from  Casinos . 
 Torró . A kind of  nougat , with strong tradition of  Xixona  and  Alicante  with, available in two styles, hard and soft. 
 Figues albardaes (a kind of  fig   fritter  that are traditional in  Falles ) 
 Bunyols . Yet another Arab-inspired pastry, these are dough-balls which are fried and covered with sugar, which can be found in various parts of Mediterranean Spain such as  Cadaqués , as well as in Madrid or even Latin America although in these cases they are not sweet. The Valencian variety habitually includes pumpkin in the dough, though often in commercial preparations this is not so. They are typical of  Falles . 
 Wines and liquors [ edit ] 
 Valencian wines are also well-regarded, with three Protected Designation of Origin:  Alicante ,  Utiel-Requena  and  Valencia . In Utiel-Requena, sparkling wine is made under the  cava  denomination. Meanwhile, muscat (known as "moscatell" also called " mistela ") is produced in the  Marina Alta  (near  Denia ) under Alicante DO and also in  Turís ,  Cheste ,  Godelleta  and surroundings, under the Valencia DO.
