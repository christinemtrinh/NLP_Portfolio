Ukrainian cuisine is the collection of the various cooking traditions of the people of Ukraine, one of the largest and most populous European countries.
It is heavily influenced by the rich dark soil (chernozem) from which its ingredients come and often involves many components.
[1] Traditional Ukrainian dishes often experience a complex heating process â€“ "at first they are fried or boiled, and then stewed or baked.
This is the most distinctive feature of Ukrainian cuisine".
[2] The national dish of Ukraine is borscht, the well-known beet soup, of which many varieties exist.
However, varenyky (boiled dumplings similar to pierogi) and a type of cabbage roll known as holubtsi are also national favourites and are a common meal in traditional Ukrainian restaurants.
[3] These dishes indicate the regional similarities within Eastern European cuisine.
The cuisine emphasizes the importance of wheat in particular, and grain in general, as the country is often referred to as the "breadbasket of Europe".
[4] The majority of Ukrainian dishes descend from ancient peasant dishes based on plentiful grain resources such as rye, as well as staple vegetables such as potato, cabbages, mushrooms and beetroots.
Ukrainian dishes incorporate both traditional Slavic techniques as well as other European techniques, a byproduct of years of foreign jurisdiction and influence.
As there has been a significant Ukrainian diaspora over several centuries (for example, over a million Canadians have Ukrainian heritage), the cuisine is represented in European countries and those further afield, particularly Argentina, Brazil, and the USA.
Bread and wheat products are important to Ukrainian cuisine.
The country has been considered one of the traditional "breadbaskets" of the world.
