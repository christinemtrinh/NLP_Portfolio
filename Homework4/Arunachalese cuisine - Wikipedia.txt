 The type of the dishes of the  Indian  state of  Arunachal Pradesh  vary within the region, according to tribal influence (with the influence of  Apatanis , Chuki,  adi  and  Nishi )
 Apong  or  rice beer  made from fermented rice or millet is a popular beverage in Arunachal Pradesh, as an  alcoholic drink . [1]  There are different varieties of rice beer with different flavours.
 The  staple food  is  rice  along with  fish ,  meat  (Lukter) and many  green vegetables . Different varieties of rice are available.  Lettuce  is the most common and preferred vegetable of all, prepared by boiling it with  ginger ,  coriander  and  green chillies  and pinch of salt. Boiled rice cakes wrapped in leaves is a famous way of packing the cooked rice. Dishes in eastern districts like Tirap and  Changlang  have some different method in their way of food preparation.
 Many wild herbs and shrubs are also part of the cuisine. Dried bamboo shoots are used extensively in cooking.Fresh bamboo shoots are very loved.
 Prior to Indian Independence when British policy to isolate the Hill people NEFA ( North-East Frontier Agency ) were in effect, wild birds and animals were a big part of their diet, but modern restrictions on hunting has made them non-existent.
