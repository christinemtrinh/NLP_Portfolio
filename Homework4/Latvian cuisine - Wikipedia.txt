 Latvian cuisine  typically consists of agricultural products, with meat featuring in most main meal dishes.  Fish  is commonly consumed due to  Latvia 's location on the eastern shore of the  Baltic Sea .
 Latvian cuisine has been influenced by other countries of the  Baltic rim . [1]  Common ingredients in Latvian recipes are found locally, such as  potatoes , [2]   wheat ,  barley ,  cabbage ,  onions ,  eggs  and  pork . Due to pronounced four seasons, the Latvian cuisine is markedly seasonal and each time of the year has its own distinctive products and dishes. [3]  Latvian food is generally quite fatty and uses few  spices . [ citation needed ] 
 
 
 Meals [ edit ] 
 Contemporary Latvians usually eat three meals a day. Breakfast is normally light and usually consists of sandwiches or an  omelette , with a drink, often milk. Lunch is eaten from noon to 3 p.m. and tends to be the main meal of the day; as such it can include a variety of foods, and sometimes also soup as an  entrée  and a dessert. Supper is the last meal of the day, with some choosing to eat another large meal. Consumption of ready-made or  frozen meals  is now common. [4] 
 
 Common foods and dishes [ edit ]

 Latvian cuisine is typical of the  Baltic region  and, in general, of northern countries. The food is high in butter and fat while staying low in spices except for black pepper, dill or grains/seeds, such as caraway seeds. Latvian cuisine originated from the peasant culture and is strongly based on crops that grow in Latvia's  maritime, temperate climate . Rye or wheat, oats, peas, beets, cabbage, pork products, and potatoes are the staples. Latvian cuisine offers plenty of varieties of bread and  dairy products , which are an important part of the cuisine. Meat features in most main meal dishes, but fish also is commonly consumed, especially in the coastal areas next to Baltic Sea. Both are also smoked. [3] 
 A lot of common dishes in contemporary Latvia come directly from other countries, often as a result of their historical domination. Popular dishes adopted from  Soviet cuisine  include  pelmeni  ( pelmeņi ) with  sour cream ,  borsch  ( borščs ),  stroganoff  ( stroganovs ),  dressed herring  ( siļķe kažokā ),  shashlik  ( šašliks ),  rasol  ( rasols ).  plov  ( plovs ),  kefir  ( kefīrs ),  kvass  and  solyanka  ( soļanka ). [5] 
 The most consumed alcoholic beverage is  beer . [6]  A national liquor is  Riga Black Balsam . [7] 
 
 Dairy products [ edit ] 
   Jāņi cheese , a  caraway  cheese traditionally served on the summer festival  Jāņi . 
 Latvia is much richer in dairy products than other Western countries.  Cottage cheese  ( biezpiens ),  sour cream  ( skābais krējums ),  soured milk  ( rūgušpiens ) and a different types of fresh and dried cheeses are available. Kefir, soured milk and other fermented milk beverages are usually consumed with hot dishes. [3] 
 Cottage cheese is frequently mixed with sour cream and eaten for breakfast, as well as added to salads and used in cakes and other desserts like the  curd snack  ( biezpiena sieriņš ). In 2012, the curd snack  Kārums  was voted the favorite product of Latvian consumers, receiving 20% of the votes. [8]   For lunch, the cottage cheese is traditionally usually eaten with boiled potatoes, lightly salted herring,  spring onions  and sour cream. [3] 
 Since the early 20th century a distinct type of butter is made in  Rucava  – the  Rucava white butter  ( Rucavas baltais sviests ) that in 2018 received the  Protected Designation of Origin  classification in  European Union . [9] [10]  Butter can also be mixed with roasted and ground hemp seeds and salt to make hemp butter ( kaņepju sviests ) that is usually eaten with rye bread. [3] 
 Seeds, nuts, dried fruits, clover or mixtures of dried herbs are often added to the cheese. It also frequently smoked or aged in oil, but fresh cheese is served with garlic or herbs. [3]  Traditional Latvian cheese is the  Jāņi cheese  made and served during the summer festival  Jāņi  and considered a symbol of  Latvian culture . [11] 
 
 Soups [ edit ] 
   Cold borscht  served with fried potatoes. 
 Soups are commonly made with vegetables and  broth  or milk.  Cold borscht  ( aukstā zupa ),  fish soup  ( zivju zupa ),  sorrel soup  ( skābeņu zupa ) and  mushroom soup  ( sēņu zupa ) are also consumed by Latvians. [3]  A traditional Latvian dessert is rye bread soup ( maizes zupa ) made from  rye bread ,  whipped cream , dried fruit and cranberries. [12] 
 Cold borscht is usually prepared in the spring and consists of kefir or  soured milk , boiled beets, chopped  radish , fresh cucumbers, boiled eggs and different greens. [3] 
 
 Bread [ edit ]

 Rye bread  ( rudzu maize ) has been a national  food staple  for centuries and is included in the  Latvian Culture Canon . The bread is similar to a Russian or German  black bread  and is made from coarse rye flour,  malt  and caraway seeds and traditionally baked in a  wood-fired oven . Another popular type of bread is sweet and sour bread ( saldskābmaize ) made from finely ground rye flour and caraway seeds. Fried rye bread with garlic ( ķiploku grauzdiņi ) and  mayonnaise  is often served as a starter in restaurants and bars.  White bread  ( baltmaize ) was considered a delicacy and was only eaten on festive occasions. [12] 
 
 Pastries [ edit ] 
   Sklandrausis 
 A popular pastry is the  speķa pīrāgi , wheat or rye flour buns filled with finely cut  streaky bacon  and onions. Sometimes caraway seeds are also added to the dough. Speķa pīrāgi are common  Ziemassvētki  and  Jāņi  pastry. [3]  Kliņģeris is a sweet  pretzel-shaped  bread that is usually served as a dessert on special occasions, such as  name day .  Sklandrausis  is a traditional dish in Latvian cuisine which has a  Livonian  origin; it's a sweet pie, made of rye dough and filled with potato and carrot paste and seasoned with caraway. In 2013, sklandrausis received a " Traditional Speciality Guaranteed " designation from the  European Commission . [13] 
 
 Drinks [ edit ] 
   A shot of  Riga Black Balsam 
 Ancient Latvians brewed  beer  ( alus ),  mead  ( miestiņš ) and honey beer ( medalus ) before the 13th century for both celebratory occasions and everyday use. After the  Baltic Crusades , the local beer brewing was influenced by the incoming Western European techniques. For example, prior to that many different herbs were used, but they were replaced by hops as a  preservative  and  flavoring agent . [14]  A craft brewery drawing upon the ancient brewing traditions is  Labietis  [ lv ]  that uses a wide variety of herbs, flowers, berries and spices in their brews. [15] 
 A very popular drink in spring is fresh  birch sap . [3]  Traditionally, it was preserved by adding  raisins , lemon rind, and blackcurrant twigs. [16]  For a long time, birch sap was sold in plastic bottles in markets and roadside stalls until Linards Liberts revamped its image and started started producing bottled birch sap, birch sap lemonade, birch sap  still  and  sparkling wine , birch sap  mulled wine  and birch sap  schnapps . [17] 
 Kvass , traditionally brewed from fermented  rye  or  black bread , has also remained popular in Latvia. In the  Latvian SSR , kvass was sold by street vendors from carts with big yellow canisters, while nowadays mass-produced kvass can be bought at supermarkets. [17] 
 With the development of cold-hardy grape varieties more suitable for the  northern climate , winemaking has become more common in Latvia. In addition to that, raspberry, black currant, and other  fruit wines  are also being made, as well as  ciders . [3]  Wine Hill of  Sabile  used to be registered in the  Guinness Book of Records  as the most northern open-air vineyard in the world. [18]  Since 1999 the town also hosts an annual wine festival.
 
 Mushrooms [ edit ] 
 Latvia has ancient traditions involving edible mushrooms. Picking wild mushrooms is very popular in autumn. Modern, as well as traditional mushroom preparation, is very popular. There are around 4,100 mushroom species in Latvia, 1,100 of those are cup mushrooms. About ¼ of these are edible. The most popular edible ones are various  Boletus  and  Cantharellus . [19]  From mushrooms, onions, garlic, sweet or sour cream and sometimes bacon a mushroom sauce is made and usually eaten with boiled potatoes and slightly salted cucumbers. [3]
