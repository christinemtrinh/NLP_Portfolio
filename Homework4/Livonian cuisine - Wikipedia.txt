 Livonian cuisine  consists of the cuisine of  Livonia  and the  Livonians , and is characterized by the rich use of local foods.  Livonians  are a coastal people – since they acquire the bulk of their food from the sea, Livonian families have historically eaten a great deal of fish. The most preferred of these is  European flounder  ( Livonian :  liestād ), but many also consume  herring  ( ēriņ ),  salted herring , and  cod  ( tūrska ). [ citation needed ] 
 
 Pastries [ edit ] 
 Courland  ( Kurāmō ) Livonians on the shores of Latvia are the source of the famous vegetable pastry,  sklandrausis  ( sūrkak ), to which the  European Commission  gave its ” Traditional Speciality Guaranteed ” designation in the autumn of 2013. 
Sklandrausis pastries are regarded as a symbol of the sun, given their round shape and carroty yellowish-orange color. The sklandrausis embodies the natural energy of the sun on Livonian tables during  spring equinox  celebrations. [ citation needed ]
