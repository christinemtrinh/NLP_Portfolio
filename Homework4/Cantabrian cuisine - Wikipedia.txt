   The  cocido montañés , the most representative dish of Cantabrian cuisine. 
 Cantabrian cuisine  includes seafood from the  Cantabrian Sea , salmon and trout from the upper basins of the rivers, vegetables and dairy products from the valleys, and veal and game from the  Cantabrian mountains .
 
 
 Fish and seafood [ edit ] 
   Rabas  are  squid -based snack commonly consumed by Cantabrians. 
   Quesada pasiega 
 Seafood is widely used, from the entire coast and the  Bay of Santander  in particular, including  clams ,  mussels ,  pod razors ,  cockles ,  crabs ,  barnacles ,  crayfish ,  snails ,  lobster , and  squid . Fish include  sea bass ,  hake ,  scorpion fish ,  anchovy ,  sardine , and  albacore .
 The  albacore  or  bonito del norte  is used in one of the most typical dishes of the region:  marmita  or  sorropotún . Some of the most renowned Cantabrian dishes are hake in green sauce ( merluza en salsa verde ), squid with onions ( maganos encebollados ) and cuttlefish in its ink sauce ( cachon en su tinta ), and clam casserole. "Rabas" (Squid sticks deep fried) is the most popular snack in the coast, typically companied with a white wine or a vermouth.
 Processed anchovies from the town of  Santoña  are highly appreciated and have a first class reputation worldwide.
 
 Meats [ edit ] 
 Veal  is widely consumed, often from the  Tudanca cattle . The National Cattle Fair of Torrelavega, the largest cattle fair in Spain, is held in Cantabria. Game is also of high quality:  deer ,  roe deer , and  wild boar .  Pork  is a key element for the  cocido montañés , literally 'mountain stew', with  beans ,  cabbage , and other ingredients.
 
 Pastry [ edit ] 
 Cantabrian pastries include the traditional  sobaos  and  quesada pasiega .  Puff pastry  is widely used, with different names in different regions:  corbatas  in  Unquera  and  San Vicente de la Barquera ,  polkas  in  Torrelavega , and  sacristanes  in  Liérganes . Other notables sweets are  frisuelo  [ es ] s  and  canónigos , both of  Liébana ;  corazones  of Liérganes, the  palucos  of  Cabezón de la Sal ; and the  tortos  and  pantortillas  of  Reinosa . Other desserts not of Cantabrian origin are  rice pudding ,  natillas ,  leche frita , and fruit  jams .
 Dairy products  include  Cantabrian cream cheese ;  picón Bejes-Tresviso  in  Tresviso  and its neighboring town;  smoked cheeses  (named for specific places) such as  Áliva  or  Pido ; and the  Quesucos de Liébana  [ es ] , made with a mixture of cow and sheep milk.
 
 Alcoholic beverages [ edit ] 
 Orujo  is the Cantabrian  pomace brandy .
Historically,  cider  and  chacoli  or  txakoli  wine were a specialty; [1] [2]  after a major and long-term decline, they are recovering. [ citation needed ] 
 Two  Spanish wines  ( vinos de la tierra ) with  denominación de origen calificada  ( protected geographical status ) from Canabria are  Costa de Cantabria  and  Liébana , named after the localities of their production.
