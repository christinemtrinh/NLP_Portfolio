 A  global cuisine  is a  cuisine  that is practiced around the world. [1] [2]  A cuisine is a characteristic style of  cooking  practices and traditions, [3]  often associated with a specific region, country [4]  or culture. To become a global cuisine, a local, regional or national cuisine must spread around the world, its food served worldwide. There have been significant improvements and advances during the last century in  food preservation ,  storage , shipping and production, and today many countries, cities and regions have access to their traditional cuisines and many other global cuisines.

 Japanese cuisine has spread throughout the world, and representative dishes such as  sushi  and  ramen , among others are popular.  In many cases, Japanese food is adapted and reinvented to fit the preferences of the local populace.  For instance, the  California roll  is a popular dish in the United States that is a modification of the Japanese  makizushi , a type of  sushi .  In  South Korea , both the Japanese curry and the ramen have been imported and popularized primarily in the form of instant food.  Tonkatsu  and  tempura , which are derived from Western food, are now considered and marketed as uniquely Japanese, as well as the  Japanese curry , which derived from the Indian curry.
 In many countries including the United States, United Kingdom, Philippines, and Brazil, Japanese restaurants have become popular.  Among these countries, Hong Kong, Taiwan, China, Singapore, Thailand and Indonesia are key consumers, according to recent research.
 The market of Japanese ingredients is also growing, with brands such as  Ajinomoto ,  Kikkoman ,  Nissin  and  Kewpie  [ ja ]  mayonnaise, are establishing production base in other Asian countries, such as China, Thailand and Indonesia.

 Traditional Chinese cuisines include  Anhui ,  Cantonese ,  Fujian ,  Hunan ,  Jiangsu ,  Shandong ,  Sichuan , and  Zhejiang , [5]  all of which are defined and termed per the respective regions within  China  where they developed. These regional cuisines are sometimes referred to as the "eight culinary traditions of China." A number of different styles contribute to Chinese cuisine, but perhaps the best known and most influential are the Sichuan, Shandong, Jiangsu and Guangdong cuisines. [6]  These styles are distinctive from one another due to factors such as available resources,  climate ,  geography ,  history , cooking techniques and lifestyle. Many Chinese traditional regional cuisines rely on basic methods of  food preservation  such as  drying ,  salting ,  pickling  and  fermentation . [7]

   Indian cuisine in the  United Kingdom 
 Indian cuisine has contributed to shaping the history of  international relations ; the  spice trade  between India and  Europe  is often cited by historians as the primary catalyst for Europe's  Age of Discovery . [8]  Spices were bought from India and traded around Europe and Asia. It has also had the created influence on international cuisines, especially those from  Southeast Asia , the  British Isles  and the  Caribbean . [9] [10]  The use of Indian spices, herbs and vegetable produce have helped shaped the cuisines of many countries around the world.
 Indian cuisine consists of the foods and dishes of  India  (and to some extent neighboring countries), is characterized by the extensive use of various  Indian spices [11]  and vegetables grown across  India , herbs, [11]  vegetables [11]  and fruits, and is also known for the widespread practice of vegetarianism in Indian society.  Indian regional cuisine  is primarily categorized at the regional level, but also at provincial levels. Cuisine differences derive from various local cultures, geographical locations (whether a region is close to the sea, desert or the mountains), and economics. Indian cuisine is also seasonal, and utilizes fresh produce.
 The cuisine of India is very diverse with each state having an entirely different food platter. The development of these cuisines have been shaped by Hindu and Jain beliefs, in particular vegetarianism which is a common dietary trend in Indian society. There has also been Islamic influence from the years of Mughal and Delhi Sultanate rule, as well as Persian interactions on North Indian and Deccani cuisine. Indian cuisine has been and is still evolving, as a result of the nation's cultural interactions with other societies. Historical incidents such as foreign invasions, trade relations and colonialism have also played an important role in introducing certain food types and eating habits to the country. For instance, potato, a staple of North Indian diet was brought to India by the Portuguese, who also introduced chiles and breadfruit among other things. Spices were bought from India and traded in exchange for rubber and opium from Malacca. It has also influenced other cuisines across the world, especially those from Southeast Asia, the British Isles and the Caribbean.

   Food courts  often offer several global cuisines. 
 American cuisine is a style of food preparation originating from the  United States of America .  European colonization of the Americas  yielded the introduction of a number of ingredients and cooking styles to the latter. The various styles continued expanding well into the 19th and 20th centuries, proportional to the influx of immigrants from many foreign nations; such influx developed a rich diversity in food preparation throughout the country.  Native American cuisine  includes all food practices of the  indigenous peoples of the Americas .
