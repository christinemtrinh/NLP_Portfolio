   Location of  Yemen 
 Yemeni cuisine  is distinct from the wider  Middle Eastern cuisines , but with a degree of regional variation. Although some foreign influences are evident in some regions of the country (with  Ottoman  influences showing in  Sanaa , while  Indian  influence is evident in the southern areas around  Aden  and  Mukalla ), the Yemeni kitchen is based on similar foundations across the country.
 
 
 Customs [ edit ] 
 The generous offering of food to guests is one of the customs in  Yemeni culture , and a guest not accepting the offering is considered an insult. [1]  Meals are typically consumed while sitting on the floor or ground. Unlike the tradition in most Arab countries, lunch is the main meal of the day in Yemen, not dinner. [1] 
 
 Food preparation [ edit ] 
 In Yemen, many kitchens have a  tandoor  (also called  tannur ), which is a round clay oven. [1] 
 
 Fruits and vegetables [ edit ] 
 Tomatoes ,  onions , and  potatoes  are some of the staple fruits and vegetables in Yemen. [2] 
 
 Meat and dairy [ edit ] 
   Homemade  mandi  is considered the national dish of Yemen; it is originally from the province of  Hadhramaut , Yemen 
 Chicken ,  goat , and  lamb  are the staple  meats  in Yemen. [2]  They are eaten more often than  beef .  Fish  is also eaten, especially in the coastal areas.
 Cheese ,  butter , and other  dairy products  are less common in the Yemeni diet.  Buttermilk , however, is enjoyed almost daily in some villages where it is most available. The most commonly used  fats  are  vegetable oil  and  ghee  used in savory dishes, while  clarified butter , known as  semn  (سمن), is the choice of fat used in  pastries .
 Pork consumption is forbidden to Muslims in Yemen, in accordance with  Islamic dietary laws .
 
 Legumes [ edit ] 
 Broad beans  are used in Yemeni dishes, such as  bean salad .  Lentils  are also used in dishes such as stews. [3] 
 
 Yemeni dishes [ edit ] 
 Breakfast dishes [ edit ] 
 Yemeni people prefer to have warm dishes in the morning. Typically, the meal consists of different types of pastries with a cup of Yemeni coffee or tea.
 A more hearty meal often includes  legumes ,  eggs , or even roasted  meat  or  kebab , which is usually served with a type of bread either aside or as a sandwich. People in Yemen also make a breakfast dish that is made from lamb or beef liver, which is considered a bizarre delicacy to non-Yemenis.
 
   A  fatoot  of fried bread with eggs 
 Dishes common at breakfast include  fattah ,  fatoot , [3]   ful medames ,  mutabbaq , and  shakshouka .
 
 Lunch dishes [ edit ] 
 Unlike most countries, lunch is the main meal of the day in Yemen, not dinner. The largest amount of meat, poultry, and grains are consumed at lunch.
 
   Jachnun  served with oven-baked egg, fresh-grated tomato, and  zhug 
 Dishes common at lunch include:
 
 Aseed —a dish made from a cooked wheat-flour lump of dough, sometimes with added butter or honey 
 Fahsa —a Yemeni stew made from lamb cutlets with lamb broth 
   Kabsa  is also known as  machbūs  in  Arab countries in the Persian Gulf 
 Fattah —a dish made with pieces of fresh, toasted, grilled, or stale flatbread covered with other ingredients 
 Haneeth —a slow-roasted lamb dish cooked in a  tannour  with a spice rub, usually served on a plate of rice

 Samak mofa [ clarification needed ] 
 Shafut — typically made with  lahoh  (a sourdough flatbread) or shredded bread,  hakeen [ clarification needed ]  (traditional buttermilk) or  yogurt ,  zhug , and  leek 
 Shawiyah [ clarification needed ] 
 Thareed —pieces of bread in a vegetable or meat broth 
 Zhug / skhug  —  a spicy green sauce made of fresh herbs, garlic, chilies, olive oil, lemon, and freshly ground spices. [4] 
 Zurbiyan —a dish made with lamb, rice, and saffron 
 National dish [ edit ] 
 After Yemen united in 1990, both North and South Yemen had similar cuisines. Despite its regional variations,  saltah  is considered to be the  national dish  of Yemen. The most common dishes consumed all over Yemen are made with rice and lamb.
 There are many ways of preparing lamb in Yemen. In general though, the lamb is usually bone-in large chunks. It can be boiled in its broth and called  maraq , it can be roasted in an oven like  haneeth , or underground like  mandi .
 
 Yemeni bread varieties [ edit ] 
   Lahuh 
 Breads  are an integral part of Yemeni cuisine, most of which are prepared from local grains. [1]  Unleavened  flatbreads  are common. [2]   Ṣalūf , a flatbread made from wheat flour, is the most common of all breadstuffs. The dough is allowed to ferment with  ḫamīrah [ clarification needed ] , while some would baste the surface of the dough with a prepared batch of unseasoned  fenugreek  ( ḥilba ) prior to baking. [5]  These were almost always baked at home in an  earthenware oven  called  tannour  (تنور) in Arabic, the size of each bread roughly being 2 cm (0.79 in) in thickness with a diameter of 20 cm (7.9 in) to 30 cm (12 in). [6] 
 Khobz al tawa ,  tameez ,  malooga ,  kader [ clarification needed ] ,  kubane ,  fateer ,  kudam [ clarification needed ] ,  oshar [ clarification needed ] ,  khameer , and  mulawah [1]  are also popular breads eaten in Yemen.  Malooj ,  khubz , and  khamir  are popular homemade breads. Store-bought  pita bread  and  roti  (bread rolls like  French bread [ dubious    –  discuss ] ) are also common.
 
 Other Yemeni grain dishes [ edit ] 
 ʻAṣīṭ — sorghum  meal,  cornmeal , or green  barley  meal made into a thick paste after being boiled in water. [7]  Before eating,  samneh  or oil is added. Some eat  ʻaṣīṭ  during the afternoon meal (usually scooped up with one's fingers), where soup and meat are served, while others place it in the soup, along with  ḥilba  ("fenugreek dollop"). [8] 
 Harīš —a thick dish ( groats ), made with cracked wheat,  1 ⁄ 4 – 1 ⁄ 3  of the kernel's full size, known collectively as  ğašūš . There are some who add  samneh  ( clarified butter ), honey or sugar to  harīš .   
 In Yemen,  harīš  is usually eaten on cold winter mornings, and, because of perceived health benefits, is given to women during the first weeks after childbirth, also to the infirm, the weak, and the frail.   
 Similarly,  harīs  is a thick grain dish (groats), made with broken wheat, rice, lentils or beans, pre-cooked in water with an added fatty portion of meat or bone marrow, along with vegetables—spring onions (scallions),  garlic , tomatoes, and more. [9]     
 Maṭīṭ —a thin, farinaceous dish (porridge), made with ground wheat or barley ( maṭīṭ šiʻīr ), drunk with  samneh , and occasionally with grated onions or sweet marjoram, which gives it a bitter taste. [8] 
 Našūf —a thin, grain-based dish (porridge), made with broken wheat, cooked with either  samneh , sugar or honey, and sipped from a bowl, usually for breakfast. Villagers cook  našūf  with sour milk, adding  zḥug  (a hot  cayenne-pepper  sauce) for added flavoring, a dish known locally as  našūf ʻalā zūm . [10] 
 Spices [ edit ] 
 A spice mixture known as  hawaij  is employed in many Yemeni dishes.  Hawaij  includes  aniseeds ,  fennel seeds ,  ginger , and  cardamom .
 Yemeni cuisine is often prepared hot and spicy with the use of  chili peppers ,  cumin ,  coriander seeds ,  turmeric , and other  spices . [3]  Herbs such as  fenugreek ,  mint , and  cilantro  are also used. [3]  Fenugreek is used as one of the main ingredients in the preparation of a paste or sauce called  holba  (also spelled  hulba ). [3]  A popular spice used in breads (including  kubane  and  sabayah ) is  black cumin , which is also known by its Arabic name  habasoda  ( habbat as sowda ).
 
 Desserts and sweets [ edit ] 
 Bint al-sahn  ( sabayah ) is a sweet honey cake or bread from Yemeni cuisine. [1] [3]  It is prepared from a dough with  white flour , eggs, and  yeast , which is then served dipped in a honey and butter mixture. [1] 
 Other common desserts include fresh fruit ( mangoes ,  bananas ,  grapes , etc.),  baklawa ,  basbousa ,  kunafah ,  zalābiya ,  halwa ,  rawani , [11]  and  masoob .  Masoob  is a banana-based dessert made from over-ripe  bananas , ground  flatbread ,  cream , cheese,  dates , and honey.
 
 Honey [ edit ] 
 In Yemen,  honey  is produced within the country, and is considered a delicacy. [1]  Locally produced honey is in high demand, and it is also considered as a  status symbol  in the country. [1] 
 
 Beverages [ edit ] 
 Shahi haleeb  ( milk tea , served after  qat ),  black tea  (with  cardamom ,  clove , or  mint ),  qishr  (coffee husks),  qahwa  (Arabic coffee),  karkade  (an infusion of dried hibiscus flowers),  naqe'e al zabib  (cold raisin drink), and  diba'a  (squash nectar) are examples of popular Yemeni drinks.  Mango  and  guava  juices are also popular.
 Although  coffee  and  tea  are consumed throughout Yemen, [2]  coffee is the preferred drink in  Sana'a , whereas  black tea  is the beverage of choice in  Aden  and  Hadhramaut . Tea is consumed along with breakfast, after lunch (occasionally with sweets and pastries), and along with dinner. Popular flavorings include  cloves  with  cardamom  and  mint . A drink made from coffee husks, called  qishr , is also enjoyed.
 Alcoholic beverages are considered improper due to cultural and religious reasons. [2]
