 Canadian cuisine  consists of the cooking traditions and practices of  Canada , with  regional variances  around the country.  First Nations  and  Inuit  have practiced their own culinary traditions in what is now Canada since time immemorial. The advent of  European  explorers and settlers, first on the  east coast  and then throughout the wider territories of  New France ,  British North America  and Canada, saw the melding of foreign  recipes ,  cooking techniques , and  ingredients  with indigenous  flora  and  fauna . [1]  Modern Canadian cuisine has maintained this dedication to local ingredients and  terroir , as exemplified in the naming of specific ingredients based on their locale, such as  Malpeque  oysters or  Alberta  beef. [1]  Accordingly, Canadian cuisine privileges the quality of ingredients and regionality, and may be broadly defined as a national tradition of "creole" culinary practices, [2]  based on the complex  multicultural  and geographically diverse nature of both historical and contemporary Canadian society.
 Divisions within Canadian cuisine can be traced along  regional lines  and have a direct connection to the historical immigration patterns of each region or province. The earliest cuisines of Canada are based on  Indigenous ,  English ,  Scottish  and  French  roots. The  traditional cuisines  of both French- and English-Canada have evolved from those carried over to North America from  France  and the  British Isles  respectively, and from their adaptation to Indigenous customs, labour-intensive and/or mobile lifestyles, and hostile environmental conditions. French Canadian cuisine can also be divided into  Québécois cuisine  and  Acadian cuisine . Regional cuisines have continued to develop with subsequent waves of immigration during the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries, such as from  Central Europe ,  Southern Europe ,  Eastern Europe ,  South Asia ,  East Asia , and the  Caribbean . There are many culinary practices and dishes that can be either identified as particular to Canada, such  fish and brewis ,  peameal bacon , and  ginger beef , or sharing an association with countries from which immigrants to Canada carried over their cuisine, such as  pierogies ,  roast beef , and  bannock .

 Though certain dishes may be identified as "Canadian" due to the ingredients used or the origin of their inception, an overarching style of Canadian cuisine may be more difficult to define. Some commentators, such as the former  prime minister   Joe Clark , believe Canadian cuisine to be a collage of dishes from a variety of cultures. Clark himself has been paraphrased to have noted that "Canada has a cuisine of cuisines. Not a stew pot, but a  smorgasbord ." [3]  Canadian food culture writer and author Jennifer Cochrall-King has said that "there is no single definition of Canadian cuisine. It starts with ingredients that spring from the landscape and with traditional dishes steeped in the region's history and culture." [4] 
 While the immense size of Canada, and the diversity of its inhabitants, compounds the difficulty in identifying a monolithic Canadian culinary tradition, Hersch Jacobs acknowledges that the lack of a hegemonic definition does not preclude the existence of Canadian cuisine. [5]   Lenore Newman  argues that there is a distinctly Canadian creole cuisine, and identifies five key properties that together define Canadian cuisine: its reliance on  seasonality ,  multiculturalism , wild foods, regional dishes, and the privileging of ingredients over recipes. [6]  This adaptation, preparation, and emphasis on specific local ingredients is of particular note, and a common theme in Canadian food is the use of foreign recipes, introduced by immigrants and their descendants, that have been modified for use of local products. [5]   Tourtière , for example, is a Canadian meat pie of French origin that can be cooked with beef, pork or fish. [7]  The sections on regionality and national foods below illustrate this tradition of diversity and emphasis on local elements, such as  dulse  and  lobster  in the  Maritimes ,  deer  meats in the  Northern Territories ,  salmon  and  crab  in  British Columbia , or  maple syrup  in  Central Canada .
 Indigenous food may be considered uniquely Canadian, and the influence of  Métis culture  can be considered to have played a particularly important role in the origin of a distinct Canadian cuisine. Foods such as  bannock ,  moose , deer,  bison ,  pemmican ,  maple taffy , and Métis  stews , such as  barley  stew, are all either traditional Indigenous foods, or originate from Canada with roots in Indigenous cuisines, and are eaten throughout the country.
 There are many foods of foreign origin that are eaten commonly and considered integrated constituents of Canadian cuisine.  Pierogies  ( dumplings  of  Central  and  Eastern European  origin) are an example of this, due to the large number of early  Ukrainian  and  Polish immigrants , while the ubiquity of  roast beef  and  Yorkshire pudding  are an example of the heavy  English  influence. As much of Canadian cuisine is coloured by the adaptation and development of dishes brought over by European, and later  Asian , settlers, there is a variety of noteworthy Canadian variations on pre-established, templated food and drink, with their own nationally defined particularities, such as Canadian  cheddar cheese ,  whisky ,  bread ,  wine ,  bacon , and  pancakes .
 In general, much of what is considered to be traditional Canadian cuisine contains strong elements of richness, breads and  starches ,  game meat , and often stews and  soups . [7]  Certain culinary traditions in Canada, such as the  frying  of  dough , which developed out of the country's voyaging and frontier culture, have seen to both the creation of distinct national foods and the flourishing of a broader national association with certain types of dishes. In the case of frying dough, for example, particular foods originating form Canada would include  beavertails ,  apple fritters  and  toutons , whilst foods such as  doughnuts , cronuts, [8]  bannock,  bagels , and  pancakes , though not physically originating from Canada, have nonetheless developed within a broader tradition of nationally recognized cuisine.
 
 History [ edit ]

 Canadian cuisine has been shaped by the historical and ongoing influences of indigenous peoples, settlers and immigrants. [5]  Indigenous influences remain prevalent in Canada's contemporary food scene, alongside those of the three major immigrant groups of the 17th and 18th centuries: English, Scottish, and French. This diversity has been further expanded by subsequent waves of immigration in later centuries. [9] 
 
 Indigenous [ edit ] 
 Main articles:  Indigenous cuisine of the Americas ,  Inuit cuisine , and  Tlingit cuisine 
 The traditional Indigenous cuisine of Canada is based on a mixture of  wild game , foraged foods, and farmed agricultural products. Indigenous peoples are known to have used more than five-hundred plant species for food. They cultivated and foraged a variety of plants, hunted a diversity of animals, and used various tools to boil, smoke/preserve and roast their food. [4]  Each region of Canada, with its own  First Nations  and  Inuit  peoples, utilized local resources and distinct preparation techniques for their cuisines.
 Maple syrup  was first collected and used by the aboriginal people of  Eastern Canada  and the  north-eastern United States , and  Canada  remains the world's largest producer. [10]  Though the origin of maple syrup production is not clear, the earliest known syrups were made by repeatedly freezing the collected maple sap and removing the ice to concentrate the sugar in the remaining sap. [11]  Maple syrup is one of the most commonly consumed Canadian food of Aboriginal origin.
 Dried meat products such as  pânsâwân  and  pemmican  are commonly consumed by the indigenous peoples of the plains. In particular, the former was a predecessor for North American-style  beef jerky , with the processing methods adapted for beef. [12] 
 In most of the  Canadian West Coast  and Pacific Northwest,  Pacific salmon  was an important food resource to the First Nations peoples, along with certain  marine mammals . Salmon were consumed fresh during the spawning season, or smoked dry to create a jerky-like food that could be stored year-round. The latter food is commonly known and sold as "salmon jerky".
 Whipped  soapberry , known as  sxusem  (sk-HOO-shum,  "Indian ice cream" ) in the  Interior Salish  languages of  British Columbia , is consumed similarly to  ice cream  or as a  cranberry - cocktail -like drink. It is known for being a kidney tonic, which are called  agutak  in  Arctic Canada  (with animal/fish fat).
 
   Sliced and prepared  muktuk 
 In the Arctic, Inuit traditionally survived on a diet consisting of land and marine mammals, fish, and foraged plant products. Meats were consumed fresh, but also often prepared, cached, and allowed to  ferment  into  igunaq  or  kiviak . These fermented meats have the consistency and smell of certain soft aged cheeses. Snacks such as  muktuk , which consist of whale skin and blubber is eaten plain, though occasionally dipped in  soy sauce . Chunks of muktuk are sliced with an  ulu  prior to or during consumption.
 Fish are eaten boiled, fried, and prior to today's settlements, often in dried forms. The so-called " Eskimo potato ", (Inuit:  oak-kuk :  Claytonia tuberosa ) [13]  and other " mousefoods ", are some of the plants consumed in the Arctic.
 Foods such as " bannock ", popular with First Nations and Inuit, reflect the historic exchange of these cultures with European fur traders, who brought with them new ingredients and foods. [14]  Common contemporary consumption of bannock,  powdered milk , and  bologna  by aboriginal Canadians reflects the legacy of Canadian colonialism in the prohibition of hunting and fishing, and the institutional food rations provided to  Indian reserves . [15]  Due to similarities in treatment under colonialism, many  Native American  communities throughout the continent consume similar food items, with some emphasis on local ingredients.

   Oatcakes  were first brought to Atlantic Canada by  Scottish Highlanders  in 1773, and remain a staple of Halifax coffee shops. [16] 
 Settlers and traders from the  British Isles  account for the culinary influences of early English Canada in the  Maritime provinces  and  Southern Ontario  (Upper Canada). [5]  Cuisines found in  Newfoundland  and the Maritimes derive largely from  British  and  Irish  cooking, with a preference for salt-cured fish, beef, and pork.  Ontario ,  Manitoba  and  British Columbia  also maintain strong British culinary traditions. The French settlers of  New France , who would become the  Canadiens  and  Acadians , account for much of the cuisine of southern  Quebec  (Lower Canada),  Northeastern Ontario , and  New Brunswick . [5] 
 Seafood  had an important influence on the early European settlers and explorers of  Atlantic Canada , which continues to be expressed in  Maritime cuisine  and culture to this day. In the late 15th-century,  John Cabot 's  journey  to the shores of what would become  Newfoundland  brought  England  knowledge of the  Grand Banks  and their abundance in  cod . He is reported to have told  King Henry VII  that "the sea was covered with fish which could be caught not merely by nets, but weighted basket lowered into the water." [17]  Fleets of fishermen from England,  France ,  Portugal , and  Spain  flocked to Newfoundland to return with fish, filling a market need in Europe and cutting out the necessity of importing from  Iceland . [18]  The English, Scottish, Irish, and French settlers of what would become the Atlantic provinces frequently built their communities beside the ocean and rivers for easy access, and the fishing industry along the Canadian east coast steadily expanded until it became the region's major industry. [18]  Accounts from early settlers list fish that were caught, sold, and incorporated into local meals, such as  trout ,  eels ,  mackerel ,  oysters ,  lobsters ,  salmon , cod and  herring . [18]  Meals that incorporated such fish included, and continue to include, fried cod roe, fried or baked cod tongues, stewed or fried cod heads, fish hash, codfish balls, cod sounds, toast and fish, roasted scrawn,  fish and brewis , salt fish and potatoes, and boiled rounders, among others. [18]  The abundance of seafood and the ease by which it could be obtained made the British and French colonies of  Nova Scotia ,  New Brunswick ,  Acadia ,  Prince Edward Island , and Newfoundland and Labrador attractive destinations for settlers.
 
   Wild turkeys in  Ottawa 
 The influx of  United Empire Loyalists  into  British North America  in the 18th century, and the subsequent establishment of  Upper Canada , saw the wider expansion of British cooking with indigenous ingredients in the future province of  Ontario . These settlers established customs similar to their compatriots in  England , but with a particular focus on dietary staples, such as meat, bread, and  tea . [19]  Local  forage  and  game  were typically incorporated into the cooking of early  English-Canadians  in Upper Canada, such as  wild berries ,  maple sugar ,  venison ,  partridge ,  waterfowl ,  maize ,  pumpkin , and  turkey . [19]  Meals often contained more meat than was typical in England and were particularly reliant on  pork  and  potatoes  during early settlement, although these meals began to include beef and mutton as farming became more established in the region. [19]   Roasting  was a common method of cooking for Upper Canadians, and  Scottish immigration , largely onset by the  Highland Clearances , brought a wider emphasis on mutton. [19]

 The  Victorian era  saw a greater swell of British immigration to Upper Canada, Lower Canada, and the Atlantic colonies, and the urban and rural development that followed encouraged the spread of eating establishments, local cookbooks, and a busier ingredients market. By the mid-19th century, there was a  tavern  every couple odd miles along the major roads of Upper Canada, and there were reportedly twenty-nine alone along the route between  Halifax  and  Digby , Nova Scotia. [20]  The larger urban centres, such as  Toronto ,  Kingston , and  Coburg  in Upper Canada,  Montreal  and  Quebec City  in Lower Canada, and Halifax in Nova Scotia, saw the opening of  hotels  that could better serve a burgeoning  upper class  of Victorian patrons. [21]  These hotels, broadly, provided  beef steak , fried pork,  buckwheat  cakes,  roast beef  and pork, wild game and fowl, vegetables,  pudding , and tea. [22]  Cookbooks published during this period include  The Home Cookbook  (1877) and  The Galt Cook Book  (1898). [23]  Traditions that developed out of the Victorian era in Canada include the Victorian cooking  fireplace , which saw continued use in homes and restaurants even after the metal  stove  was introduced, and  picnics , which often involved  ham , fowl,  meat pies ,  tarts , and  cakes . [24] 
 In the territory of  Rupert's Land , the development of communities throughout the 17th, 18th, and early 19th centuries, which centered around  Hudson Bay Company  and  North West Company  trading posts, saw to the intermingling of European (largely Scottish and French) traders, clerks, guides, and canoers with the local Indigenous population. [25]  The resulting genesis of the  Métis  culture saw to the development of a cuisine in the  Canadian West  which combined the culinary traditions of these previously separate groups.
With the arrival of the  Earl of Selkirk  and his Scottish retinue (people largely displaced by the Highland Clearances), as well as the purchase of forty-five million acres of land in the  Red River Valley , many Scottish culinary traditions were brought to the region. [25]  These foods included  black bun ,  haggis , honey cakes, and  rowies . Cooperation with the local Métis saw Scottish immigrants hunting buffalo and incorporating game into their meals. [25] 
The completion of the  Canadian Pacific Railway  in the late 19th-century led to a significant influx of not just settlers of British origin, but of also a multitude of different backgrounds, notably  Ukrainian ,  Polish ,  German ,  Scandinavian ,  Belgian ,  Dutch ,  Greek ,  Czech ,  Slovak ,  Chinese ,  American ,  Mennonite , and  Jewish . [25]  It is in this way that the  Canadian Prairies , or the future provinces of  Alberta ,  Saskatchewan , and  Manitoba , were a frontier of multicultural community-building in Canada, and the creation of a regional cuisine which absorbed influences from a variety of ethnic, national, and religious backgrounds.
 Icelandic  immigration has a particular influence on the cuisine of Manitoba, which, besides  Iceland  itself, has a larger  Icelandic population  than anywhere else in the world. One example is  vinarterta , a layer cake filled with prune jam and flavoured with cardamom, and a popular Christmas treat in Manitoba. Bakeries in the province often include other pastries brought over and adapted from Iceland, including  kleinur  (similar to  doughnuts ),  laufabrauõ  (flatbread decorated with patterns),  kransakaka  (a type of cake with  almonds ), and  ugbraud  (a  rye bread ). [26] 
 Ontario's southwestern regions also have strong Dutch and  Scandinavian  influences. [ citation needed ]

 In Canada's  Prairie  provinces, which saw significant immigration from Eastern and Northern Europe in the pre-WWI era,  Ukrainian ,  German , and  Polish cuisines  are strong culinary influences. Such examples include  perogies ,  kielbasa , and  babka . Emigration from Russia to Western Canada in the late 19th and early 20th centuries also established a  Doukhobor  influence, noted in particular for its emphasis on  vegetarian  recipes on the cuisine of the  British Columbia Interior  and the Prairies. [5] 
 The  Waterloo ,  Ontario , region and the southern portion of  Manitoba  have traditions of  Mennonite  and  German  cookery.
 Jewish immigrants  to Canada during the late 1800s played a significant culinary role within Canada, chiefly renowned for  Montreal-style bagels  and  Montreal-style smoked meat . A regional variation of both emerged within  Winnipeg, Manitoba 's Jewish community, which also derived Winnipeg-style cheesecake from New York City recipes. Winnipeg has given birth to numerous other unique dishes, such as the  schmoo torte , smoked goldeye and "co-op style" rye bread and cream cheese.

   Sai Woo restaurant and  heritage building  in  Vancouver Chinatown 
 Chinese immigration to Canada , beginning predominantly in the 1850s, saw to the local modification of dishes imported from  Qing China . Much of what are considered to be "Chinese dishes" in Canada are largely  Canadian  or North American inventions, with Chinese restaurants having tailored their  traditional cuisine  to local tastes, local ingredients, and a largely non-Chinese clientele. [5]  This " Canadian Chinese cuisine " is widespread across the country, with great variation from place to place. Examples of such variation are seen in unique regional dishes, including Calgary  ginger beef , [27]  Montreal peanut-butter dumplings, [28]  Newfoundland  chow mein , [29]  and Thunder Bay  bon bons . [30] 
 The "Chinese  buffet ", although found in other parts of North America, traces its origins to early  Gastown ,  Vancouver , c.1870. This meal format developed from the practice of Chinese restaurateurs providing a steam table on a  sideboard  to serve  Scandinavian  lumberjacks working in local forests and mills.

 Japanese-Canadians  have had a profound influence on the cuisines of British Columbia and Ontario. Distinct varieties of  sushi , such as the  B.C. roll  and the  California roll , originate from the  Metro Vancouver  region, while  sushi pizza  was invented in Toronto.  Japadog  street food in Vancouver is also a popular example of Canadian west coast fusion cuisine.

   Kedgeree , an  Anglo-Indian  dish imported from the  British Raj , is commonly found in  Indo-Canadian  restaurants. 
 Indian  and  South Asian  culinary influences are a relatively recent addition to Canadian cuisine, having gained wider prominence in the country during the post-1960's era of immigration, [31]  despite earlier South Asian settlement in British Columbia dating back to the late 19th century. [32]  Indian food is particularly popular in Canada, deriving mostly from  Northern Indian  cuisine. It is characterized for its use of bread, curry, and use of yogurt and cream for meat-based dishes; it also draws inspiration from  South Indian  cuisine in its use of sour and spicy combinations. [31] 
 Unique  Indo-Canadian  food includes the  East Indian roti  wrap, which gained popularity in  Toronto  during the 1980s and 1990s; using  North Indian / Pakistani  bread and curries as stuffing, local chefs originally drew inspiration from the  West Indian roti  which had entered the city's food scene in the 1960s and 1970s after a wave of  Caribbean  immigration. [33]  Also known as butter chicken roti, [34]  the dish is served at many Indian restaurants and fast food locations across  Southern Ontario . [35] 
 Other Canadian food unique to the  South Asian community  includes "Indian-style pizza" (also known as "Punjabi-style pizza" or "Desi-style pizza") [36]  which has gradually gained popularity since the 1980s [37]  in major urban centres across  western  and  central Canada  with large South Asian populations, including  Greater Vancouver , [38] [39]   Calgary , [40]   Edmonton , [41]   Regina , [42]   Winnipeg , [36]   Ottawa , [43]  and  Greater Toronto , [44]  later expanding to other regions. [45]  This type of pizza typically includes sauce with mixed spices and toppings such as  cilantro ,  ginger ,  spinach ,  cauliflower ,  tandoori chicken ,  butter chicken , or  paneer . [36]

 Contributions from Southeast Asia to Canadian cuisine includes a style of medium-thick crust  pizza Margherita  in Toronto. An example of  fusion cuisine , the pizza is topped with garlic and basil oil topping, combining an Italian pizza with the  Vietnamese  tradition of using herbed oil toppings in food. [46]

 Wild game of all sorts is still hunted and eaten by many Canadians, though not commonly in urban centres.  Venison , from  white-tailed deer ,  moose ,  elk  ( wapiti ) or  caribou , is eaten across the country and is considered quite important to many  First Nations  cultures. [60]   Seal meat  is eaten, particularly in the  Canadian North , the  Maritimes , and  Newfoundland and Labrador . Wild fowl like  ducks and geese ,  grouse  (commonly called partridge) and  ptarmigan  are also regularly hunted. Other animals like  bear  and  beaver  may be eaten by dedicated hunters or indigenous people, but are not generally consumed by much of the population.
 Seafood is a very common constituent of Canadian cuisine broadly, but particularly in British Columbia and the Atlantic provinces. West Coast salmon varieties include  sockeye ,  coho ,  chinook  (also known as king), and  pink , while salmon used on the East Coast can be broadly defined as  Atlantic salmon . Freshwater fish, such as the  walleye  (also known as pickerel) and  lake whitefish  are commercially fished in the Great Lakes and are popular in southern Ontario. Both wild-caught and farmed  rainbow trout  are consumed throughout Canada.
 Although the majority of Canada's fish yield is captured wild, about 28% of the country's yield came from  aquaculture  in 2018. [61]  British Columbia accounts for 49% of the country's total aquaculture production volume, while the Maritime provinces account for 46%. Canada is the world's fourth-largest producer of farmed salmon, and other species, such as  trout ,  Arctic char ,  mussels ,  oysters , and  clams  are well established industries. [62] 
 Forage in Canadian cooking can include a variety of berries, mushrooms,  Canada rice  and  herbs . Wild  chanterelle ,  pine ,  morel ,  lobster ,  puffball , and other  mushrooms  are commonly consumed.  Gooseberries ,  salmonberries ,  cranberries ,  strawberries , Saskatoonberries, cloudberries, soapberries,  blackberries ,  blueberries ,  bilberries ,  currants , and  huckleberries  are gathered wild or grown.
 Alberta  is renowned for its production of  beef ; in 2016, Alberta's cattle herd accounted for 41.6% of the national total. [63]  Alberta beef is thought to have a rich marbled flavour due to the province's nutritious  grasslands  and  barley . Examples of local recipes that utilize Alberta beef include  beef tartare ,  bistecca ,  short ribs , ginger fried beef, and grilled steak. [64]  Canada ranks among the world's top 10 per capita consumers of beef. [65] 
 Saskatchewan  is often referred to as the " breadbasket  of Canada"; it accounts for nearly 50% of Canada's total crop yield and for two-fifths of the country's total field acreage. [66]  In 2016,  canola  and  spring wheat  were the two largest crops,  Saskatoon berries  accounted for over half of the "fruit, berry and nut area", and  sweet corn  was the largest field vegetable crop by area. [66]  Saskatchewan also produces most of the country's spice yield, particularly  mustard , but also  caraway  and  coriander . [67]

 Cheese [ edit ] 
   Balderson "Royal Canadian Cheddar". Canadian cheddar is a particularly smooth and creamy  cheddar cheese  that holds a balance between flavour and sharpness. [111] 
   Oka cheese  was originally manufactured in the  Trappists  monasteries of  Oka, Quebec  and  Holland, Manitoba 
 Dairy products  became prominent among Central Canadian producers in the 1860s. Ontario's first cheese factory opened in 1863, and by the end of the decade, they had expanded to over two-hundred. The 1860s also saw to the start of a shift from wheat production to dairy and livestock in Quebec, which would become the dominant agricultural sector in the province by the early 20th century. Cream and cheese factory production would begin to increase exponentially in both Central and Eastern Canada by the 1880s. [112] 
 Canada is currently the 12th largest producer of cheese by tonnage, [113]  and is considered to be one of the major cheese-producing countries. [114]   Canadian cheese  is mostly "firm", with  cheddar  and  mozzarella  being the most produced varieties in 2020. [114]  Among Canadians, specialty cheese (such as  cream cheese ,  cottage cheese , and  parmesan ) is the most popular type, with cheddar being the second-most. [114]  The list given below, taken from an international database of cheese varieties, [115]  is an account of over one-hundred Canadian cheeses:

   Bottle of 12-year Canadian whisky 
 Canada is considered one of the top  whisky-producing countries , and is most renowned for  rye whisky . [144]  Regulation states that  Canadian whisky  must age for a minimum of three years and be kept in oak barrels. [144]   Canada houses about thirty whisky  distilleries  across the country, and produces 54.2 million liters. [145]  Canadian whisky is noted for its light and smooth style, and though most of it is blended, [145]   single-malt  and 100% rye are some of the country's most desired. [146]  The  Glenora Inn & Distillery  is the only single-malt distillery in North America. [146]

 Street food [ edit ] 
 This section needs to be  updated .  Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.   ( March 2021 ) 
   "Terimayo" from the Japadog street cart on  Burrard Street  and Smithe, Vancouver 
 While most major cities in Canada offer a variety of  street food , each region has specialties which reflect local cultural influences.  Montreal  food trucks offer  shish taouk , the  Montreal hot dog , and dollar  falafels .  Although falafel is available in  Vancouver , East Asian-influenced offerings are much more widespread, including  sushi ,  samosas , Vietnamese  banh mi  subs or  Pho  soup, Filipino offerings, and various Japanese and Chinese cuisines. In  Victoria, British Columbia , vegan and vegetarian burgers are common, as are various seafood take-aways and Mexican-influenced street food. Since 2007, Toronto has encouraged vendors to sell street food from a wider variety of cuisines. [154] 
 In Western Canada, a version of the Ukrainian garlic-pork sausage, referred to as " Kubasa " (a corruption of the  Ukrainian sausage  "Kobasa") [155]  is widely available and celebrated. [156]  The term "smokies" or "smokeys" may refer to Kubasa rather than  frankfurters .
 Fusion cultural foods  are constantly evolving, such as the  Japadog , which tops a  hot dog  with traditional Japanese ingredients, such as wasabi, teriyaki, shredded daikon radish, or bonito (fish) flakes. Pizza slices are a common street offering.  Shawarma  is quite prevalent in  Ottawa  and  Windsor , while  Halifax  offers its own unique version of the  döner kebab  called the  donair , which features a distinctive sauce made from  condensed milk , sugar, garlic and vinegar.  Ice cream trucks  can be seen (and often heard due to a jingle being broadcast on loudspeakers) nationwide during the summer months. Winnipeg has a particularly famous line-up of food truck vendors on  Main Street .
 
 Street food markets [ edit ] 
 Various street food markets exist across the country. Metro Vancouver offers the " Richmond  Night Market", with over two-hundred retail stalls offering predominantly East Asian-inspired food, such as grilled octopus, takoyaki, dumplings, fish sticks, and taiyaki. [157]  As well, there is the "Shipyards Night Market" in  North Vancouver , which is more varied in its offerings and provides more than thirty-five food trucks per week over the course of its annual run. [157] 
 In Alberta, notable street food markets include the "Calgary Night Market", as well as the "Calgary Stampede Night Market", and Edmonton's "What the Truck?". [157]  The  Greater Toronto Area  runs "Market 707", "Adelaide Eats", and "Night It Up!". [157]  Market 707 on  Dundas Street  is of particular aesthetic note given that it is formed out of refurbished shipping containers. [157]  Eastern Canada also maintains several street food markets of note, including Montreal's "First Fridays" and Halifax's "Trusk-Side". [157] 
 
 National food of Canada [ edit ] 
   Maple syrup is widely recognized as  emblematic of Canada , both internationally and within the country itself 
 Though finding consensus among  Canadians  in determining a national food or dish can prove difficult, there are nonetheless several items broadly recognized as being representative of Canada's national cuisine. Foods typically considered  national dishes  of Canada include poutine [158] [159] [160] [161]  and butter tarts. [162] [163]  Canadian back or peameal bacon, as well as Atlantic or Pacific salmon, are also commonly thought of as representative of Canada. [164] 
 Published by the  Statista  Research Department, a June 2015 poll asked Canadians, "If Canada were to identify one of the following as official national food, which should it be?" The results revealed Canadian bacon to be the top choice, followed by poutine: [164] 
 
 Canadian bacon (35%) 
 Poutine (30%) 
 Atlantic or Pacific salmon (17%) 
 Beavertail (8%) 
 Toutiere (6%) 
 Doughnut (4%) 
 CanCulture Magazine conducted a 2021  social media  poll that sampled from fifty-five Canadians given ten choices. The poll revealed the following results: [165] 
 
 Poutine (38.9%) 
 Maple syrup (25.9%) 
 BeaverTails (9.3%) 
 Peameal bacon and Timbits (7.4% each) 
 According to an informal survey by  The Globe and Mail  conducted through  Facebook  from collected comments, users considered the following to be the Canadian national dish, with maple syrup likely above all the other foods if it were considered: [161] [ better source needed ] 
 
 Poutine (51%) 
 Montreal-style bagels (14%) 
 Salmon jerky (dried smoked salmon) (11%) 
 Pierogi/Perogy (10%) 
 Ketchup chips (7%) 
 Nova Scotian donair (4%) 
 California roll (1%) 
 Canada's most "iconic" foods were named in a survey conducted by the  Canadian Broadcasting Corporation , in the summer of 2012, as: [166] [ better source needed ] 
 
 Maple syrup 
 Poutine 
 Nanaimo bars, smoked salmon and butter tarts 
 In 2020, Hayley Simpson [167]  identified the "best signature Canadian dishes" as poutine, Nanaimo bars, butter tarts, beavertails, tourtière, pea soup, Halifax donair, Saskatoon berry pie, and Montreal-style bagels. The following year,  Reader's Digest  published an article [168]  similarly listing "10 Must-Try Canadian Dishes" as poutine, Canadian bacon, caesar, beavertails, Canadian pizza, butter tarts, Nanaimo bars, split pea soup, tourtière, and ketchup (namely "ketchup" chips).
 
 Meal formats [ edit ] 
   Coffee from Pronto Café in Vancouver. Canada is the 10th largest consumer of coffee in the world, consuming more coffee per capita than any other  English-speaking country . [169] 
 As in other countries, Canadian meals are commonly segmented accordingly to their suitability for the time of day.
 Breakfast  takes place in the morning and typically consists of a variety of foods, such as  toast ,  biscuits ,  muffins ,  scones ,  pancakes ,  bacon ,  bagels ,  cereals ,  fruit  and  eggs , among others. Breakfast condiments are very common and can often include an assortment of  jam ,  cream cheese ,  peanut butter ,  marmalade , or  nutella . Typical drinks include  water ,  juice ,  coffee , and  tea . Breakfast traditionally occurs before work or school on weekdays, or otherwise soon after waking up in the morning. An archetypal French-Canadian meal may contain more  starch -based material, while an English-Canadian meal might consist of more  protein . [170] 
 
 Lumberjack's breakfast, aka logger's breakfast, aka "The Lumby"—a gargantuan breakfast of three-plus eggs, rations of ham, bacon and sausages, and several large pancakes.  This was invented by hotelier J. Houston c.1870, at his Granville Hotel on Water Street in old pre-railway  Gastown , Vancouver, in response to requests from his clientele for a better "feed" at the start of a long, hard day of work. [171] [172] 
 Coffee  customarily refers to a small meal during a break from labour. This involves the consumption of a  snack  that, although it is the typical drink of choice (hence the name), may or may not include  coffee . The  Canada Labour Code  requires employers to provide 30-minute breaks for every five consecutive hours of work. [173] 
 Lunch  generally takes place around noon.  Sandwiches ,  soups ,  fruit ,  nuts ,  cheese  and a variety of  snacks  are common foods during this meal. Lunches are usually compact, utilitarian, and/or casual, particularly given that they are often eaten at work, school, or otherwise outside of the home. [170] 
 Afternoon tea  is a common practice in English Canada and takes place around 16:00. [174]  This tradition often overlaps with  afterschool snack  and is commonly considered to be a marker for the end of one's daily obligations, whether it be work or school.
 Dinner  usually takes place from anywhere between 17:00 to 19:00, and tend to be heartier affairs based around protein and  vegetables . Local flora and fauna are most fully realized during dinner; in the Maritimes, dinner may be more likely to include fish, while the Prairies might include more beef. [170] 
 
 Sunday dinner  in Canada is commonly observed as a more formal affair than typical dinners, often involving family and/or guests, and a more thoroughly prepared meal.  Roast beef  is a common centerpiece, [175]  but particular specialties also vary by region, such as traditional Prairie  pot roast [176]  and Newfoundland Jiggs Dinner. [177] 
 Occasions [ edit ] 
   The annual pancake breakfast at the  Chinook Centre  in  Calgary  feeds over 60,000 in one day. 
 Chinese  buffet  or  smorgasbord  is a particular meal system invented in  Gastown, Vancouver  and prevalent throughout the country. This style of buffet was developed in the 19th century by Chinese immigrants in order to cater to the local clientele of  Scandinavian Canadian   loggers . Staples of Chinese-Canadian cuisine, as well as North American Chinese cuisine broadly, such as ginger beef,  chow mein , and dumplings, are commonly available. [178] 
 Christmas dinner  in Canada draws from the traditions of both Britain and France. [179]  These dinners are typically meant to serve a  larger group  than is usual, with the  pièce de résistance  often being  turkey ,  roast beef , and/or  ham . Sides often include  stuffing ,  mashed or roast potatoes ,  gravy ,  cranberry sauce , and cooked vegetables (such as  carrots  or  yams ). [180]   Pies  and  cakes  are common desserts. Treats during the  Christmas season  typically include  tarts ,  shortbread  and  gingerbread , bar, square, and "snowball" pastries,  toffee , roll  kuchen  (particularly in the Prairies),  crème brûlée , and  biscotti . [181]   Easter weekend  (April),  Victoria Day  weekend (May), and  Canadian Thanksgiving  (October) tend to share certain culinary customs with Christmas, albeit with different ingredients based on  seasonality . 
 Pancake breakfast  is a traditional public meal, particularly in  Western Canada , which takes place during festivals, celebrations, and community events. This tradition has roots in the Prairies'  ranching culture , as well as the  Christian tradition  of  Shrove Tuesday . Such events that take part in a pancake breakfast include the  Calgary Stampede ,  Grey Cup festival , and  K-Days . 
 Potlatch  is a gift-giving feast practiced by  Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest . Although the occasion as a whole incorporates complex political, social, and economic elements, feasting is still a central aspect of the practice. [182] 
 Réveillon  is a long dinner held in the evenings preceding Christmas Day and  New Year's Eve , and is a traditional practice for French-Canadians across the country. Meals tend to be particularly opulent, and may include lobster, oysters,  escargot ,  foie gras , and tourtière. A traditional dessert for this occasion is  yule log .

 While an abundance of  livestock breeds  and crops originating from other countries are grown and raised in Canada, there is also a variety of unique breeds and  cultivars  that have been developed domestically. Below is a selection of various livestock breeds and cultivars that originate from Canada.

   The "Aurora Golden Gala" was created in  Summerland, British Columbia  at the  Pacific Agri-Food Research Centre 
 Due to an influx of grain from the Prairies into British Columbia during the late 19th century, via the advent of the  Canadian rail network , the province's grain production became largely redundant. This allowed for the development of specialized produce industries, such as fruit in the  Okanagan . As a result, many of Canada's unique apple varieties have been developed in the interior of British Columbia. [112]
