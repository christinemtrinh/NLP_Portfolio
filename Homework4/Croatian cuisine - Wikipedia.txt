 Croatian cuisine  is heterogeneous and is known as a cuisine of the regions, since every region of  Croatia  has its own distinct culinary tradition. Its roots date back to  ancient times . The differences in the selection of foodstuffs and forms of cooking are most notable between those in mainland and those in coastal regions. Mainland cuisine is more characterized by the earlier Slavic and the more recent contacts with  Hungarian  and  Turkish cuisine , using  lard  for cooking, and spices such as  black pepper ,  paprika , and  garlic . [1] [2]  The coastal region bears the influences of  Greek  and  Roman  cuisine, as well as of the later  Mediterranean cuisine , in particular  Italian  (especially Venetian). Coastal cuisines use  olive oil , herbs and spices such as  rosemary ,  sage ,  bay leaf ,  oregano ,  marjoram ,  cinnamon ,  clove ,  nutmeg , and lemon and orange rind. Peasant cooking traditions are based on imaginative variations of several basic ingredients (cereals, dairy products, meat, fish, vegetables, nuts) and cooking procedures (stewing, grilling, roasting, baking), while bourgeois cuisine involves more complicated procedures and use of selected herbs and spices.  Charcuterie  is part of the Croatian culinary tradition in all regions. Food and recipes from other  former Yugoslav countries  are also popular in Croatia.
 Croatian  cuisine can be divided into several distinct cuisines ( Dalmatia ,  Dubrovnik ,  Gorski Kotar ,  Istria ,  Lika ,   Međimurje ,  Podravina ,  Slavonija ,  Zagorje ) each of which has specific cooking traditions, characteristic of the area and not necessarily well known in other parts of Croatia. Most dishes, however, can be found all across the country, with local variants.

 Main article:  Croatian wine 
 Croatia has two main wine regions: Continental (Kontinetalna) and Coastal (Primorska), which includes the islands. Each of the main regions is divided into sub-regions which are divided yet further into smaller vinogorje, (literally wine hills) and districts. Altogether, there are more than 300 geographically defined wine-producing areas in Croatia.  In parts of Croatia, wine, either red or white, is sometimes consumed mixed in approximately two thirds wine and one third of mineral water. [ citation needed ]
