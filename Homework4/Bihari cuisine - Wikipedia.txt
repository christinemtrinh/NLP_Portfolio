 Bihari cuisine  is eaten mainly in the eastern  Indian  state of  Bihar , as well as in the places where people originating from the state of Bihar have settled:  Jharkhand , Eastern  Uttar Pradesh ,  Bangladesh ,  Nepal ,  Mauritius ,  South Africa ,  Fiji , some cities of  Pakistan ,  Guyana ,  Trinidad and Tobago ,  Suriname ,  Jamaica , and the  Caribbean . Bihari cuisine includes  Bhojpuri cuisine , [1]   Maithil cuisine  and  Magahi cuisine .
 The cuisine of  Bihar  is largely similar to  North indian cuisine  and  East Indian  cuisines. It is highly seasonal; watery foods such as  watermelon  and  sharbat  made from the pulp of the  wood-apple fruit  are consumed mainly in the summer months, while dry foods such as preparations made of sesame seeds and poppy seeds are consumed more frequently in the winter months.
 Bihari cuisine include  litti chokha , [2]  a baked salted wheat-flour cake filled with  sattu  (baked chickpea flour) and some special spices, which is served with  baigan bharta , [3]  made of roasted eggplant ( brinjal ) and tomatoes. [4] [5]   Dairy  products are consumed frequently throughout the year, including  dahi  ( yogurt ), spiced  buttermilk  (known as  mattha ),  ghee ,  lassi  and  butter .
 There are numerous Bihari meat dishes, with  chicken  and  mutton  being the most common.  Fish  dishes are especially common in the  Mithila region  of North Bihar due to the number of rivers, such as the  Sone ,  Gandak ,  Ganges  and  Koshi . Among meat dishes, meat  saalan [6]  is a popular dish made of mutton or goat curry with cubed potatoes in  garam masala .  Dalpuri  is another popular dish in Bihar. It is salted wheat-flour bread, filled with boiled, crushed, and fried gram pulses. [7] 
 Malpua  is a popular sweet dish of Bihar, prepared by a mixture of  maida , milk, bananas, cashew nuts, peanuts, raisins, sugar, water, and green cardamom. Another notable sweet dish of Bihar is  balushahi , which is prepared by a specially treated combination of  maida  and sugar along with  ghee , and the other worldwide famous sweet,  khaja  is made from flour, vegetable fat, and sugar, which is mainly used in weddings and other occasions.  Silao  near  Nalanda  is famous for its production. During the festival of  Chhath ,  thekua , a sweet dish made of  ghee ,  jaggery , and whole-meal flour, flavoured with  aniseed , is made. [4] 
 
 
 
 Bihari thali [ edit ] 
 As the seasons change so does the Bihari  thali , every 3–4 months. The constants are  rice ,  roti ,  achar ,  chatni ,  dals  and milk products, with some variation.
 For the frying and  tempering  ( chhounkna  /  tadka ) of certain vegetable dishes, Bihari cuisine makes use of  vegetable oil  or  mustard oil  and  panch phoron  — literally the "five spices":  fennel seed  ( saunf ),  black mustard seed  ( sarson ),  fenugreek seed  ( methi ),  cumin seed  ( jeera ) and  nigella seed  ( kalonji  or  mangraeel ). There is a lot of light frying ( bhoonjnaa ) in Bihari cuisine.
 One remarkable tradition is "smoked food", referring to the use of smoked red chilli to infuse a strong aroma in food. Smoked chilli is used in preparing  chokhaa , i.e. mashed  brinjals  / potatoes / tomatoes, either single or combined. Smoked chilli is also used in preparing kadam chutney (the  kadam  is a common fruit that is sweet-sour in taste).
 
 Traditional cuisine [ edit ] 
 Traditional Bihari cuisine Litti ,  Kadhi bari ,  Ghugni ,  Khichdi 
 Kadhi bari [8]  - These fried soft dumplings made of besan ( gram flour ) are cooked in a spicy gravy of yogurt and besan. They go well with plain rice. 
 Khichdi [9]  - A mix of rice, dal and several vegetables, steamed together to give a distinctive taste of different ingredients combined in one dish. It is often topped up with  ghee . 
 Ghugni  - A preparation made of black grams soaked (either lightly or overnight) in water and then sautéed in mustard oil in a wok. All kinds of  garam masala  made as paste on a sil is used for flavouring; chana is also ground to form a paste used as thickener. This thickens the masala and makes gravy as per desire. After proper seasoning and  bhunjana , water is added to the mix for gravy as desired. 
 Pittha  - A sort of dumpling that can be either salty or sweet. It is a semi-circular or ball-shaped preparation whose crust is made of soft rice flour and filled with preparations made of  channa daal  lentil paste, or poppy seeds and  gur  ( jaggery ), then steamed in water or milk and allowed to thicken. 
 Sattu  - Powdered baked gram, an energy-giving food usually mixed with water or milk. Sometimes, sattu mixed with spices is used to prepare stuffed  chapattis , locally known as  makuni roti . 
 Dhuska  - A deep-fried item prepared from a mixture of powdered rice and ghee, and salted. 
 Litti  - Powdered baked gram is mixed with chopped onions, green chillies, lemon juice, and coriander leaves. This mixture is filled inside atta and either barbecued over coal or deep-fried with oil. Best accompanied with ghee, curd and  baigan chokha  or  aloo chokha .

 Non-vegetarian cuisine [ edit ] 
   Bihari kebab 
 The distinctive  Bihari  flavour of non-vegetarian cooking finds mention in the memoirs of Maulana  Abul Kalam Azad , who found it quite tasty. Forms of  kebabs ,  mutton  preparations and dishes prepared from various  fowl  and birds have a distinctive flavor.  Biharis  are quite famous for their Bihari kebabs, another typical Bihari non-vegetarian dish. [21]  This dish was traditionally made from mutton and is eaten with  roti ,  paratha  or boiled  rice . The region of  Champaran  is famous for a grilled mutton dish called  taash . Recently, in fast food restaurants, Bihari kebabs are also sold as Bihari kebab rolls, which are essentially kebabs wrapped up in a  paratha .
