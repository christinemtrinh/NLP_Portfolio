   Chelow kabab  is considered to be the  national dish  of Iran. [1] 
 Iranian cuisine  ( Persian :  آشپزی ایرانی ,  romanized :  Āshpazī Irānī ) are the culinary traditions of  Iran . Due to the historically common usage of the term " Persia " to refer to Iran in the  Western world , [2] [3] [4]  it is alternatively known as  Persian cuisine , despite  Persians  being only one of a multitude of  Iranian ethnic groups  who have contributed to Iran's culinary traditions. [a] 
 The cuisine of Iran has made extensive contact throughout  its history  with the cuisines of its neighbouring regions, including  Caucasian cuisine ,  Central Asian cuisine ,  Greek cuisine ,  Levantine cuisine ,  Mesopotamian cuisine ,  Russian cuisine  and  Turkish cuisine . [6] [7] [8] [9]  Aspects of Iranian cuisine have also been significantly adopted by  Indian cuisine  and  Pakistani cuisine  through various historical  Persianate  sultanates that flourished during  Muslim rule on the Indian subcontinent , with the most notable and impactful of these polities being the  Mughal Empire . [10] [11] [12] 
 Typical Iranian main dishes are combinations of  rice  with  meat ,  vegetables  and  nuts .  Herbs  are frequently used, along with fruits such as  plums ,  pomegranates ,  quince ,  prunes ,  apricots  and  raisins . Characteristic Iranian spices and flavourings such as  saffron ,  cardamom , and  dried lime  and other sources of sour flavoring,  cinnamon ,  turmeric  and  parsley  are mixed and used in various dishes.
 Outside of Iran, a strong presence of Iranian cuisine can be found in cities with significant  Iranian diaspora  populations, namely the  San Francisco Bay Area ,  Toronto , [13] [14] [15] [16]   Houston  and especially  Los Angeles and its environs . [13] [14] [17] 
 
 
 History [ edit ] 
 Among the writings available from the  Middle Persian  scripts, the treatise of  Khosrow and Ridag , points about stews and foods and the way of using them and how they are obtained in the Sassanid period are found as valid references in compiling the history of cooking in Iran. The names of many of the Iranian dishes and culinary terms that have been translated can be seen in Arabic language books. This was probably due to the fact that a large number of Iranians were involved in the court and administrative apparatus of the  Abbasid caliphs , and naturally their customs and habits influenced the life of the Arabs, including the Iranian method of cooking during the  Abbasid period .
 Ancient Persian  philosophers and physicians have influenced the preparation of Iranian foods to follow the rules of the strengthening and weakening characteristics of foods based on the  Iranian traditional medicine . [18] 
 
 Historical Iranian cookbooks [ edit ] 
 Although the Arabic cookbooks written under the rule of the  Abbasid Caliphate —one of the Arab caliphates which ruled Iran after the  Muslim invasion —include some recipes with  Iranian  names, the earliest surviving classical cookbooks in  Persian  are two volumes from the  Safavid  period. The older one is entitled "Manual on cooking and its craft" ( Kār-nāmeh dar bāb e tabbāxī va sanat e ān ) written in 927/1521 for an aristocratic patron at the end of the reign of  Ismail I . The book originally contained 26 chapters, listed by the author in his introduction, but chapters 23 through 26 are missing from the surviving manuscript. The recipes include measurements for ingredients—often detailed directions for the preparation of dishes, including the types of utensils and pots to be used—and instructions for decorating and serving them. In general, the ingredients and their combinations in various recipes do not differ significantly from those in use today. The large quantities specified, as well as the generous use of such luxury ingredients as  saffron , suggest that these dishes were prepared for large aristocratic households, even though in his introduction, the author claimed to have written it "for the benefit of the nobility, as well as the public."
 The second surviving Safavid cookbook, entitled "The substance of life, a treatise on the art of cooking" ( Māddat al-ḥayāt, resāla dar ʿelm e ṭabbāxī ), was written about 76 years later by a chef for  Abbas I . The introduction of that book includes elaborate praise of God, the prophets, the  imams , and the  shah , as well as a definition of a master chef. It is followed by six chapters on the preparation of various dishes: four on rice dishes, one on qalya, and one on āsh. The measurements and directions are not as detailed as in the earlier book. The information provided is about dishes prepared at the royal court, including references to a few that had been created or improved by the shahs themselves. Other contemporary cooks and their specialties are also mentioned. [19] 
 
 Staple foods [ edit ] 
 Rice [ edit ] 
 The usage of  rice , at first a specialty of the  Safavid Empire 's court cuisine, evolved by the end of the 16th century CE into a major branch of Iranian cookery. [20]  Traditionally, rice was most prevalent as a major  staple item  in northern Iran and the homes of the wealthy, while bread was the dominant staple in the rest of the country.
 Varieties of rice in Iran include  gerde ,  domsia  (literally meaning black-tail, because it is black at one end),  champa , doodi (smoked rice), Lenjan (from  Lenjan County ), Tarom (from  Tarom County ), and anbarbu.
 The following table includes three primary methods of cooking rice in Iran.
 
 
 
 Method
 
 Description
 
 
 Polow  and  chelow 
 
 Chelow is plain rice served as an accompaniment to a stew or kebab, while polow is rice mixed with something. They are, however, cooked in the same way. Rice is prepared by soaking in salted water and then boiling it. The parboiled rice (called  chelow ) is drained and returned to the pot to be steamed. This method results in an exceptionally fluffy rice with the rice grains separated and not sticky. A golden crust called  tadig  is created at the bottom of the pot using a thin layer of bread or potato slices. Often, tadig is served plain with only a rice crust. Meat, vegetables, nuts, and fruit are sometimes added in layers or mixed with the chelow and then steamed. When chelow is in the pot, the heat is reduced and a thick cloth or towel is placed under the pot lid to absorb excess steam.
 
 
 Kateh 
 
 Rice that is cooked until the water is absorbed completely. It is the traditional dish of  Gilan Province .
 
 
 Dami 
 
 Rice that is cooked almost the same as kateh, but at the start, ingredients that can be cooked thoroughly with the rice (such as grains and beans) are added. While making kateh, the heat is reduced to a minimum until the rice and other ingredients are almost cooked. If kept long enough on the stove without burning and over-cooking, dami and kateh can also produce tadig. A special form of dami is  tachin , which is a mixture of yogurt, chicken (or lamb), and rice, plus  saffron  and egg yolks.

 Bread [ edit ] 
 Second only to rice is the production and use of  wheat . The following table lists several forms of  flatbread  and pastry bread commonly used in Iranian cuisine.
 
 
 
 Lavash : Thin, flaky, and round or oval. It is the most common bread in Iran and the Caucasus.
 
 Sangak : Plain, rectangular, or triangle-shaped leavened flatbread that is stone-baked.
 
 Taftun : Thin, soft and round-shaped leavened flatbread that is thicker than lavash.
 
  Qandi bread: A sweet bread, sometimes  brioche -like and sometimes flat and dry. [21] 
 
 Barbari : Thick and oval flatbread; also known as  Tabrizi , referring to the city of  Tabriz .
 
 
 Baguette : A long, narrow  French  loaf, typically filled with  sausages  and vegetables.
 
 Sheermal  ("milk-rubbed"): A sweet pastry bread, also widely known as  nan-e gisou 
 
 Komaj: A sweet date bread with turmeric and cumin, similar to nan e gisu. [22] 
 
 Fruits and vegetables [ edit ] 
 The  agriculture of Iran  produces many fruits and vegetables. Thus, a bowl of fresh fruit is common on Iranian tables, and vegetables are standard side dishes with most meals. These are not only enjoyed fresh and ripe as desserts but are also combined with meat as accompaniments to main dishes. [23]  When fresh fruits are not available, a large variety of dried fruits such as  dates ,  figs ,  apricots ,  plums  and  peaches  are served instead. Southern Iran is one of the world's major date producers, where some special  cultivars  such as the  Bam date  are grown.
 Vegetables such as  pumpkins ,  spinach ,  green beans ,  fava beans ,  courgette , varieties of  squash ,  onion ,  garlic  and  carrot  are commonly used in Iranian dishes.  Tomatoes ,  cucumbers  and  scallion  often accompany a meal. While the  eggplant  is "the potato of Iran", [24]  Iranians are fond of fresh green salads dressed with  olive oil ,  lemon juice ,  salt ,  chili , and  garlic .
 Fruit  dolma  is probably a specialty of Iranian cuisine. The fruit is first cooked, then stuffed with meat, seasonings, and sometimes tomato sauce. The dolma is then simmered in meat broth or a sweet-and-sour sauce. [25] 
 Verjuice , a highly acidic juice made by pressing unripe grapes or other sour fruit, is used in various Iranian dishes. [26]  It is mainly used within soup and stew dishes, but also to simmer a type of squash dolma. Unripe grapes are also used whole in some dishes such as  khoresh e qure  (lamb stew with sour grapes). As a spice, verjuice powder ( pudr e qure ) is sometimes reinforced by verjuice and then dried.
 
 Typical spices [ edit ]

 Advieh  or  chāshni  refers to a wide variety of pungent vegetables and dried fruits that are used in Iranian cuisine to flavor food.
 One of the traditional and most widespread Iranian spices is  saffron , derived from the flower of  Crocus sativus .  Rose water , a flavored water made by steeping  rose  petals in water, is also a traditional and common ingredient in many Iranian dishes.
 Persian hogweed  ( golpar ), which grows wild in the humid mountainous regions of Iran, is used as a spice in various Iranian soups and stews. It is also mixed with vinegar into which broad beans are dipped before eating.
 Some other common spices are  cardamom , made from the seeds of several  Elettaria  and  Amomum  plants;  shevid , an annual herb in the celery family  Apiaceae ;  mahleb , an aromatic spice made from the seeds of  Prunus mahaleb ; and  limu amani , dried lime.
 There are also several traditional combinations of spices, two of which are  arde , made from toasted ground hulled sesame seeds, and  delal sauce , made of heavily salted fresh herbs such as cilantro and parsley.
 
 Typical food and drinks [ edit ] 
 Typical Iranian cuisine includes a wide variety of dishes, including several forms of  kebab ,  stew ,  soup , and  pilaf  dishes, as well as various  salads ,  desserts ,  pastries , and  drinks .

 In Iran, kebabs are served either with rice or  with bread . A dish of chelow  white rice  with  kebab  is called  chelow kabab , which is considered the  national dish  of Iran. The rice can also be prepared using the  kateh  method, and hence the dish would be called  kateh kabab .

[49]   The ice was mixed with  saffron , fruits, and various other flavors. Today, one of the most famous Iranian desserts in the semi-frozen noodle dessert known as  faloodeh , which has its roots in the city of  Shiraz , a former capital of the country. [50] [51]   Bastani e zaferani ,  Persian  for "saffron ice cream", is a traditional Iranian ice cream which is also commonly referred to as "the traditional ice cream".

 Drinks [ edit ] 
   A cup of Iranian tea, served in Tehran 
 Iran is one of the world's major tea producers, [57] [ better source needed ]  mostly cultivated in its northern regions. In  Iranian culture , tea ( čāy ) is widely consumed [58] [59]  and is typically the first thing offered to a guest. [60]  Iranians traditionally put a lump of  sugar cube  in the mouth before drinking the tea. [61]   Rock candies  are also widely used, typically flavored with  saffron .
 
   Café Pars,  Tehran  (1936) 
 Iran's traditional  coffee  ( qahve , or  kāfe ) is served strong, sweet, and "booby-trapped with a sediment of grounds". [62]  In 16th-century  Safavid Iran , coffee was initially used for medical purposes among the society. [63]  Traditional  coffeehouses  were popular gatherings, in which people drank coffee, smoked tobacco, and recited poetry—especially the epic poems of  Shahnameh . [64]  In present-day Iran, cafés are trendy mostly in urban areas, where a variety of brews and desserts are served. [62]   Turkish coffee  is also popular in Iran, more specifically among  Iranian Azeris . [65] [66] 
 Wine  ( mey ) has also a significant presence in Iranian culture.  Shirazi wine  is Iran's historically most famous wine production, originating from the city of  Shiraz . [67] [68] [69]  By the 9th century, the city of Shiraz had already established a reputation for producing the finest wine in the world, [68]  and was Iran's wine capital. Since the  1979 Revolution , alcoholic beverages  have been prohibited in Iran ; though non-Muslim recognized minorities (i.e.  Christians ,  Jews , and  Zoroastrians ) are allowed to produce alcoholic beverages for their own use. [70]  While non-alcoholic  beer  ( ābjow ) is available from legal outlets, other citizens prepare their alcoholic beverages illegally through the minority groups [71] [72] [73]  and largely from  Iraqi Kurdistan  and  Turkey . [74] 
 Araq sagi , literally meaning "doggy distillate", is a type of  distilled alcoholic beverage  in Iran which contains at least 65% pure ethanol.

There is also the traditional pastry of  shekerbura  ( şəkərbura ), which is identical to  Khorasan 's  shekarpare  ( šekarpāre ). Despite the influences from Turkey, the food tastes noticeably Iranian, though also with its own unique features, such as using more lemon juice and butter than other groups of Iranians. [82]

[88]  Some local Kurdish dishes include a traditional grilled rib meat that is called  dande kabāb , [89]  a type of  khoresh  made of  chives  that is called  xoreš-e tare , [90]  and a dish of rice and potatoes that is called  sib polow .

 Structure [ edit ] 
 Meals [ edit ] 
 Breakfast [ edit ] 
 The basic traditional Iranian breakfast consists of a variety of flat breads,  butter  cubes, white cheese, whipped heavy cream ( sarshir ; often sweetened with honey), nuts (especially walnuts) and a variety of fruit jams and spreads.
 Many cities and towns across Iran feature their own distinct versions of breakfast dishes.  Pache , a popular traditional dish widely eaten in Iran and the neighboring  Caucasus , is almost always only served from three in the morning until sometime after dawn, and specialty restaurants (serving only pache) are only open during those hours.
 
 Lunch and dinner [ edit ] 
 Traditional Iranian cooking is done in stages, at times needing hours of preparation and attention. The outcome is a well-balanced mixture of herbs, meat, beans, dairy products, and vegetables. Major staples of Iranian food that are usually eaten with every meal include  rice , various herbs, cheese, a variety of flat breads, and some type of meat (usually  poultry ,  beef ,  lamb , or  fish ). Stew over rice is by far the most popular dish, and the constitution of these vary by region.
 
 Traditional table setting and etiquette [ edit ] 
 Traditional Iranian table setting firstly involves the tablecloth, called  sofre , and is spread out over either a table or a  rug . Main dishes are concentrated in the middle, surrounded by smaller dishes containing appetizers, condiments, and side dishes, all of which are nearest to the diners. When the food is perfectly served, an invitation is made to seat at the  sofre  and start having the meal.

Persian cuisine is characterized by the use of lime and saffron, the blend of meats with fruits and nuts, a unique way of cooking rice, and Iranian hospitality. Food is subtly spiced, delicate in flavour and appearance, and not typically hot or spicy. Many recipes date back to ancient times; Iran's historical contacts have assisted in the exchange of ingredients, flavours, textures, and styles with various cultures ranging from the Mediterranean Sea region to China, some of whom retain these influences today.
