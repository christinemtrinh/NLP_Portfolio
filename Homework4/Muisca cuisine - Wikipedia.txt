 Muisca cuisine  describes the food and preparation the  Muisca  elaborated. The Muisca were an advanced civilization inhabiting the central highlands of the  Colombian   Andes  ( Altiplano Cundiboyacense ) before the  Spanish conquest of the Muisca  in the 1530s. Their diet and cuisine consisted of many endemic flora and fauna of Colombia. 
 The main product of the Muisca was  maize , in various forms. The advantage of maize was that it could be grown in the various climatic zones the Muisca territories experienced. [1]  It was the basis for their diet and the alcoholic drink,  chicha , made from fermented maize and sugar. 
 In the  Muisca religion  their agriculture and celebration of harvests, conducted along the complex  Muisca calendar , were protected by  Chaquén  and  Nencatacoa . The Muisca ate a variety of roots and tubers and even had a specific word in their  Chibcha language  for eating those:  bgysqua . [2] 
 
 
 Muisca cuisine [ edit ] 
   Chicha , an alcoholic beverage made from maize and sugar 
   Aba,  maize, the main product for the Muisca 
 The Muisca cultivated many different crops in their own regions, part of the  Muisca Confederation , and obtained more exotic culinary treats through trade with neighbouring  indigenous peoples , with as most important; the  Lache  (cotton, tobacco, tropical fruits, sea snails),  Muzo  (emeralds, Magdalena River fish, access to gold, spices),  Achagua  (coca, feathers,  yopó , Llanos Basin fish, curare). 
 The climatic variation of the Muisca territories allowed for the  agriculture  of different crops.  Javier Ocampo López  describes the Muisca diet as predominantly vegetarian:  potatoes ,  maize ,  beans ,  mandioca ,  tomatoes ,  calabazas ,  peppers  and numerous fruits. The Muisca also used grains known today as  quinoa . 
 The main base for the Muisca cuisine was maize, considered a holy crop. The Muisca roasted  corn  (maize), ate it off the plant or converted it into  popcorn . 
 Main meat was the  guinea pig ,  endemic  to  South America , which they farmed in their homes. In special cases they ate  llamas ,  alpacas ,  deer ,  capybara  ( chigüiro  in Spanish), and fish from the rivers and lakes of the  Altiplano Cundiboyacense  and Magdalena and Llanos through trade. The Muisca drank a lot of  chicha , a fermented alcoholic drink of maize and sugar, served in  ceramic  pots called  urdu  or  aryballus . [3] 
 Paleodietary studies performed on the  Bogotá savanna , where 18 Muisca skeletons ranging in historical age from 8th to 10th century AD and 26 skeletons from the 12th and 13th century AD, together with analysis of 10  mummies  of the  Guane ,  Lache  and Muisca were analysed, have shown that about 60% of the food of the people consisted of vegetary products and 40% of meat and especially fish.
 After the Spanish conquest, the access to meat was drastically reduced changing the diet of the Muisca and other indigenous groups of central Colombia. Studies from  Tunja , called Hunza in the time of the Muisca, have shown the people did not suffer from malnutrition though. [4] 
 
 Words for maize [ edit ] 
   Fica,  maize leaf 
   Agua,  maize kernels 
   Chiscami,  black maize 
 As maize was the most important crop and food for the Muisca, their language ( Muysccubun ) had many different words for maize, parts of the plant and the different processes and eating habits. [5]

 Main article:  Muisca agriculture 
 The Muisca cultivated their crops in so-called  camellones , artificially elevated surfaces that allowed the roots of the crops to be sufficiently irrigated with the average 700-1000 mm of rain a year and drainage systems regulating the water levels. [6] 
 Main plants to be cultivated were:
 
 Canna edulis  or  achira , one of the first plants cultivated in the Andes [7] 
 Arracacia xanthorrhiza  or  arracacha , ideally grown at altitudes of 1,800 metres (5,900 ft) and above, used in soups, grilled, boiled, fried or baked [8] 
 Tropaeolum tuberosum , ideally grown at high altitudes exceeding 3,000 metres (9,800 ft) [9] 
 Oxalis tuberosa — although this root is not native to Colombia, it was used by pre-Columbian societies in Cundinamarca and Boyacá, after being introduced from its place of origin in Peru, where the majority of varieties are found [10] 
 Ullucus tuberosus  or  ulluco , used in various traditional dishes, still today [11] 
 Yacón , eaten raw, usually with a bit of salt, also eaten traditionally today [12] 
 Solanum tuberosum ,  Solanum colombianum ,   Solanum andigens ,  Solanum rybinii  and  Solanum boyacense , different types of  potatoes  were a lesser part of the Muisca diet; maize was more important [12] 
 Manihot esculenta  or  yuca , a very important tuber in the diet of the South American indigenous people, cultivated as of 1120 BCE and still one of the most important ingredients in Colombian and other Latin-American cuisine [13] 
 Ipomoea batatas , sweet potatoes, as evidenced from 3200 years before present in  Zipacón [14] 
 Grains and cereals [ edit ] 
 Zea mays  or corn, earliest use of corn dated to 150 BCE in  Zipaquirá , 275 BCE in  Tequendama  and even up to 2250 BCE [15] 
 Chenopodium quinoa ,  quinoa , originating from  Peru , more than 5000 years before present [16] 
 Phaseolus vulgaris ,  common bean , first domesticated in  Mexico ,  Central America , Peru and Colombia [17] 
 Arachis hypogaea ,  peanuts , grown in the Andes and in Alto Magdalena [18] 
 Erythrina edulis , called  chachafruto  or  balú , growing at altitudes between 1,200 metres (3,900 ft) and 1,800 metres (5,900 ft) [18]

 Physalis peruviana  or  uchuva , typical fruit of Colombia, grown at altitudes above 2,200 metres (7,200 ft) [24]
