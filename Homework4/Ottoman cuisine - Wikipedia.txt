 Today,  Turkish cuisine  is a continuation of Ottoman cuisine.
 
 
 Sources [ edit ] 
 The Ottoman palace kitchen registers ( matbah-i amire defterleri ) are important primary sources for studies of early modern Ottoman cuisine containing information on ingredients and names of food dishes cooked by the palace kitchens. [1] 
 Many cookbooks were published beginning in the 19th century reflecting the cultural fusions that characterized the rich cuisine of Istanbul's elites in the Late Ottoman period as new ingredients like tomatoes became widely available. [2] [3]  There are few extant recipe collections before this era. [4] 
 The earliest Ottoman cookbook is credited to Muhammad Shirvânî's 15th-century expansion of the earlier Arabic  Kitab al-Tabikh  by  Muhammad bin Hasan al-Baghdadi . [5] [6] 
 Diwan Lughat al-Turk  (the earliest Turkish language dictionary) is often consulted as a source for the influence of Turkic cuisine, although scholars caution against uncritically assuming the words still meant the same thing hundreds of years later in geographically distant Anatolia. [7] 
 
 History [ edit ]

 Influences [ edit ] 
 Ottoman cuisine represents the synthesis of  Central Asian ,  Persian ,  Balkan ,  Arab  and  Byzantine  culinary traditions, enriched by the introduction of new spices and ingredients during the  Columbian Exchange . [8] [9]   Maxime Rodinson  has argued that food historians "need to show that [foods] do not have a common, parallel origin in Graeco-Roman cooking before we adduce any oriental influence" because, according to Rodinson,  Latin Europe , Islam and the  Byzantine Empire  all evolved from "the civilization of antiquity". [10]  This type of "mutual exchange and enrichment" is a typical feature of culinary history. [11] 
 The  Seljuk -era  foodways  of the  Turkic tribes  were influenced by the cultures they had encountered during their  migrations  from the  Altay Mountains  to Anatolia, including Persian cuisine. [8]   Ayran  is often considered to be part of the central Asian heritage of the Turkic tribes. Pilaf dishes exist in both Central Asian and Persian cuisine making it difficult to trace the path of diffusion back to its starting point.
 
 New ingredients [ edit ] 
 Ottoman trade introduced new ingredients to the empire's regional cuisines, contributing to the evolving, unique character of Ottoman foodways.  Levantine cuisine  was enriched by the new ingredients from Asia and the Americas.  Fernand Braudel  credits the Ottomans with introducing rice, sesame and maize to the region. [12] [13] 
 Although tomatoes had entered the cuisine by the 1690s, they are not found in the few recipe manuscripts that survive from the 18th century. Ayşe Fahriye has recipes for both green tomatoes ( kavata ) and red tomatoes ( domates ) in  Ev Kadını . Some of the recipes like tomato pilaf and dolma are still common in modern  Turkish cuisine . Fahriye's 1882 cookbook is the last mention of green tomatoes in Ottoman cooking. [14]  Mehmet Kamil's influential 1844 manuscript includes recipes for tomato stew, stuffed tomato  dolma  and tomato pilaf.
 Also from the Americas were potatoes,  haricot beans , peppers, tomatoes, pumpkin, corn and zucchini.
 
 Diffusion [ edit ] 
 The court cuisine was diffused through the provinces by Ottoman officials. [15] 
 The influence of Ottoman cuisine in Europe beginning in the early 16th century is seen in dishes like  sharbat , which spread first to Italy after  Franceso I de'Medici  requested a recipe for "Turkish sorbette" in 1577.  Rice pudding , described in contemporaneous sources as "Turkish-style rice", was served at the wedding of  Ercole I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara  in 1529. Similar to the Western-style confection  nougat ,  koz halva  is found in the  cuisines of Central Europe , where it is called  Törökméz  ('Turkish honey') in Hungarian, and  Türkischer Honig  in Austria and southern Germany. [16] 
 
 Characteristics [ edit ] 
   Dolma 
   İmam bayıldı 
 The Ottoman Empire spanned three continents, representing a wide range of climate zones and flora and fauna, and so the cuisine includes not only the cuisine of the Ottoman Palace, but a rich diversity of regional specialties. [17] 
 
 Böreks and pastries [ edit ] 
 The iconic Ottoman stuffed pastry  börek  may be related to the triangular  sanbusak  pastries of Safavid cuisine. The cognate term  senbuse  appears in Turkish sources as early as the 13th century, becoming corrupted as  samsa . [18] [19]  ( Samsa  are often associated with  Uzbek cuisine .) [20] [21] 
 The term "börek" does not appear in  Kashgari's dictionary  but two recipes for  pirak  are recorded in the 14th century  Yinshan Zhengyao , a Chinese cookery manuscript from the  Mongol Yuan  era. The description of  Danishmend Gazi 's wedding feast in  Danishmendname  mentions both samsa and "well-buttered böreks". [22] 
 Ottoman banquets in the 19th century served a mix of  Alafranga and alaturca  foods. At these dinners,  börek  was sometimes replaced by the similar French pastry,  bouchée  or  bouchée à la Reine . [23] 
 The pastry  boyoz  (etymologically linked to the Spanish  bollos  meaning "small loaves") may date to the arrival of Sephardic Jews in 1492. In modern times the pastry is found mainly in the city of Izmir where it represents the cultural heritage and contributions of  Ottoman Jews . [24] [25] 
 
 Bread [ edit ] 
 Bread was made with wheat and classified according to the quality and origin of the flour. Istanbul's demand for grain could not be met by local production alone and it received shipments from the Thracian coastlands, western Anatolia,  Dobruja ,  Macedonia  and  Thessaly . [26] 
 Many types of bread were baked in the palace kitchens—flat white bread ( fodula ), loaves of good quality whole wheat ( somun ) and white bread ( fırancala ) and  filo  ( yufka ). [12]  The addition of seeds like sesame and aniseed, or spices like cloves, was considered a luxury. Evliya Çelebi noted "the fine white Mudejar francala bread", referring to the European-style bread baked by the  Mudéjar  in Galata. [27] 
 Lapa ,  keşkek  and other Ottoman porridge dishes were less expensive alternatives to white bread.

 Desserts [ edit ] 
   Ashure 
   Baklava 
   Tavuk göğsü 
 Sugar was still prohibitively costly in the 17th century; far more common were honey and syrups like  pekmez , made with grapes.
 The wheat berry pudding  aşure , in modern times a part of the Islamic holy day  Ashura , has roots in the  harvest rituals  of the  Neolithic  period, since which time domesticated  wheat  is known to have been cultivated at  Karaca Dağ . [16] 
 There are multiple competing theories of the origin of  baklava , variously ascribing it to the Ancient Roman  placenta cake , Perisan  lauzinaj  or the influence of Central Asian desserts, found also in the milky layered dessert  güllaç . [16]  Dernschwam describes a baklava-like dish made by cooking thin wafers of starch flour and egg white, then filling with layers of sugared nuts with rosewater and nutmeg to create a dessert about as thick as a finger. 
 Dernschwam describes  zerde  as rice pudding that is cooked in honeyed water and colored with  saffron , garnished with toasted almonds and served with fruits.  Muhallebi  is also listed among the foods Dernschwam encountered on his travels.
 Visiting Europeans noted with interest the Ottoman manner of serving sweet dishes between other courses, instead of at the end of the meal as the custom was in France and other European countries. German army officer  Helmuth von Moltke  whilst serving in the  Ottoman Empire  noted the unusual presentation of courses with the sweet courses served between roasts and other savory dishes. [28]   Edward Lear 's account of a banquet in Ottoman Albania similarly notes the unexpected order of courses, roast meats followed by honeyed pastries, fruits followed by shellfish, savory and salted meats and stews followed by chocolate, and so on, he says, innumerable courses were served in confounding permutations of sweet, sour and salty combinations.
 
 Dolma [ edit ] 
 Dolma  were made by stuffing whole fruits and vegetables, or by wrapping leaves around a filling, either minced meat or spiced pilaf. [29] 
 Dernschwam described a stuffed vegetable dish of young pumpkins and aubergines (which he calls  podliczschan ), stuffed with cubed mutton and garlic filling, and served with yogurt. He also describes the dish called  sarma  as stuffed vine leaves cooked with sour plums.
 
 Drinks [ edit ] 
 Coffeehouses  developed first in the Ottoman Empire and spread to Italy, then across Europe. [30]  There were coffeehouses,  sharbat  shops and  bozahanes  around the port of Galata where imported coffee, sugar and other colonial goods arrived to Istanbul in the 18th century. [31]  Bozahanes were one of the most popular public hangouts in 15th and 16th century Bursa until overshadowed by the coffeehouses in the 17th centuries. These were lucrative businesses that generated tax revenue and rent. [32] 
 Thomas Smith mentions boza in the 17th century  Epistola de moribus ac institutis Tucarum : "They also have other liquors peculiar to them of which I shall only mention  Bozza  made from  millet ."
 
 Fish [ edit ] 
 Jean de Thévenot  described the fish market of  Galata  in the 17th century:
 
 The most beautiful fish market in the world is located on the marina, on a street where fish shops occupy both sides, offering large quantities of fish of all varieties...The Greeks run many taverns/cabarets in Galata, where they attract many rascals... 
 Anchovies were a favorite in the coastal city of  Trabzon . One of the many dishes recorded by Evliya Çelebi in his Book of Travels ( Seyahatnâme ) is an  anchovy  dish from  Trebizond . Cooked in a stoneware pan, the anchovies are arranged in rows and covered with a cinnamon and black pepper scented mixture of leeks, celery, parsley and onions. The vegetable and fish layers alternate to fill up the pan, and olive oil is poured over the top. Çelebi described the dish as "like congealed light, and one who eats it is full of light ... This fish is indeed a table from heaven". [33] 
 
 Fruits, nuts & seeds [ edit ] 
 Many different fruits and nuts are recorded in the palace records. [34]   Pomegranates  were sourced from villages around the  Marmara Sea .  Üsküdar 's fields and meadows had been converted to vineyards by the end of the 16th century. Oranges were not introduced until the 18th century, tangerines even later. Bananas, pineapples and other tropical fruits are not mentioned in any known records from the 19th-century imperial kitchens. [35] 
 Fruits were used to make  sharbat  and  compotes . Sugar was too expensive for all but the wealthiest members of Ottoman society, and desserts,  compotes  and  sharbat  were more likely to be sweetened with dry fruits, molasses or honey. [12]  There were hundreds of shops in 17th-century Istanbul specializing in preparations of the Ottoman-style compote  hoşaf , often taken at the end of a meal.
 Cakes and bread with poppy seed filling had been consumed in Byzantium since Roman times, a tradition that continued under the Ottoman Turks, entering  Central European cuisine  and the related culinary culture of  Ashkenazi  Jews.
 
 Meat dishes [ edit ] 
   Pastırma 
 Kebabs ,  mantı ,  köfte ,  pastırma  and  yahni  are types of meat dishes associated with Ottoman cuisine. [36]  Evliya Çelebi describes shish kebab on skewers and meat slow-cooked in tandoor ovens. He says there were hundreds of stalls in the city of Istanbul selling kebabs and kofta. [37] 
 Ottoman kebabs were slow-cooked in their own juices in earthenware casseroles ( çömlek ) or tandoor ovens. The recipe named "as the Turk likes it" from Hungarian noblewoman  Anna Bornemisza 's collection uses this technique: [38] 
 
 Sprinkle salt on the meat then roast it. Wash the rice well and boil it in water until soft. Wash the meat, place it in the pot and cover with beef or chicken juices. If you do not have these juices, boil it in melted butter, but so that it remains in one piece. When you serve it, turn it over onto a "platter", sprinkle with olive oil and a little sugar; in this way it will be tastier. 
 Stuffed roasted lamb with a filling of rice and raisins was served at a feast held in honor of  Mahmud II 's sons. [39]  It was a choice offering at the garden parties of Istanbul's elites. [40]  In 1719 stuffed lamb was served as a feast organized by the newly appointed governor of  Mosul . [41]  The 13th century  Danishmendname  describes whole stuffed lambs served at a wedding feast:  Çevirme kuzıların dolmış içi. 
 Hunting for food was common. Sultan  Ahmed I  hunted rabbits at the palace in Üskudar. This style of hunt in gardens was practiced in Byzantine times at  Blachernae Palace . The 19th-century hunting lodge  Ihlamur Pavilion  was designed by the Ottoman-Armenian architect  Nikoğos Balyan  in Istanbul for Sultan  Abdulmejid I . Deer, wolves and foxes were all hunted, but rabbits were by far the most common game. [42] 
 
 Offal [ edit ] 
 Ottoman court proceedings show that the  boza  peddlers claimed, by custom, exclusive rights to sell sauteed liver kebab (cığer). [43] 
 
 Rice pilaf [ edit ] 
 Rice was mostly imported from Egypt and used to make  pilaf . In  Ottoman language  pilaf dishes were called  dane , a term borrowed from the  Persian language . [44]  Made with mulberries, stir-fried meats, honey, pomegranates and  gourds , rice dishes were rich and varied, at least for the wealthy. [45] [46]   Evliya Çelebi 's description of rice dishes draws a distinction for the long-grain Persian rice used in  dane  dishes, which he calls  çilav  (چلو). [47] [48]  He reports attending a feast in  Bitlis  where rice dishes were presented  ambrette seeds , partridge,  kofta  and eggs. These festive platters were often enriched with almonds, pistachios and currants. [49] 
 
 Soups and stews [ edit ] 
 Hans Dernschwam, a 16th-century German traveler, confirms that  çorba  ( Ottoman Turkish :  چوربا ) was a common dish of this period, prepared with butter and rice for the  janissary  corps. According to Dernschwam, most 16th-century Ottoman soups began with a base of  chicken stock  and rice, with different vegetables added, although lamb stock was also used. [50]  Garlicky  işkembe çorbası  (tripe soup) was sold in the early morning hours by  Ottoman Greeks  as a hangover cure. [33] 
 Soup could be thickened with a mixture of egg and flour or bread and an acidic ingredient such as lemon juice, and served over stale bread. This style of soup could be found, with some variations, in Balkan territories like Romania and  Hungary , as well as in Turkey. [50] 
 Hand-cut soup noodles called  erişte  are a basic dish found in  Central Asian cuisine . [50]   Tutmaç  and  erişte  are both mentioned in the 13th century  Danishmendname .
 
 Spices [ edit ] 
   The  Spice Bazaar 
 When  Mehmed II  took the city of  Constantinople  in 1453, the Turks gained control of the  spice trade  in the eastern Mediterranean. [51]  Spices were used in health tonics produced by the palace  confectionary  that could be consumed as sweets and for health purposes, and could include up to 60 different spices in their preparation. [33] 
 According to Evliya Çelebi, the local melons in  Diyarbekir  were seasoned with cinnamon and cloves, according to the "recipe of Caliph Mu'awiya". The upper echelons of Ottoman society ate  aniseed  perfumed bread. Street vendors in Istanbul sold warm milk drinks sprinkled with fragrant cinnamon or ginger. Fish stews often included cinnamon, and  kebabs  could be spiced with cumin. Breads were made with seeds, cumin and spices either mixed into the dough or sprinkled on top. [33] 
 A 17th-century report says that the used of spice in Istanbul was moderate and mostly limited to black pepper, but as the intensity of spice is subjective, other reports differ. The 16th-century Flemish  herbalist  and diplomat  Ogier Ghislain de Busbecq  described the Ottoman culinary culture as "very frugal", with a simple meal of bread and salt, garlic or onion and  yoghurt  being all that was needed for nourishment. [52]   Lady Mary Wortley Montagu , writing in the 18th-century, says Ottomans use "a great deal of rich spice", and that she was unable to eat the food as the intensity of flavors took their toll on her and she "began to grow weary of it and desired our own cook might add a dish or two after our manner". [33] 
 
 Sweet and sour [ edit ] 
 Sweet and sour dishes were typical of classical Ottoman cooking. [53]   The Turkish epic  Danishmendname  records "They put lots of fig and apricot in sour dishes, as well as raisins and dates."
 The sweet and sour lamb dish  mutancana  is rumored to have been one of  Mehmed II 's favorite courses. The recipe survives in Shirvani's 15th century manuscript, and some versions  appear in Romanian cookbooks, most likely influenced by cultural contact with Hungary. [54] 
 Mahmudiyye  is a sweet and sour chicken and noodle dish of note from the Shirvani manuscript. [55] 
 
 Vegetables [ edit ] 
   A modern example of the stuffed eggplant dish  karnıyarık 
 Palace archives from the reign of  Mehmed II  confirm purchases of carrots, cucumbers, eggplants, parsley, spinach and chard in the late 15th century. 
 Leeks  are native to the eastern Mediterranean and are mentioned in the  Old Testament  Numbers 11:15. [56]   Prasa  (پراصه‎), as they were called, were a staple food for  Salonican Jews  who suffered economic hardship during the  Capitulations of the Ottoman Empire . [57] [58] 
 Braising was a typical way of cooking vegetables in the 19th century Ottoman Empire, sometimes with the addition of lamb. By the 1880s printed recipes had added tomato in the preparation of braised dishes. Vegetables were also used in the preparation of stuffed  dolma . [29] 
 
 Pickles [ edit ] 
 Dernschwam wrote that, while cabbage was found, the Turks did not know how to cook it with beef like the Hungarians, saying they instead pickled it, a common preparation in those days. [59]  Pickled cabbage was known as early as Byzantine times according to the description of a Byzantine feast recorded in ' Danishmendname . 
 
 Palace cuisine [ edit ] 
 Background [ edit ] 
 Of the four Ottoman Palaces,  Edirne Palace ,  Topkapı Palace ,  Dolmabahçe Palace  and  Yıldız Palace , it is Topkapı that for 400-years oversaw the development of the classical Ottoman palace cuisine. Topkapı could host up to 4,000 persons at a time and the kitchen staff was huge. At one 18th-century event at least 1,000 chefs were required to prepare a meal of pilaf, soup and  zerde  for 10,000 attendant  janissaries . [17] 
 Ottoman palace cuisine was amalgamated and honed in the Imperial Palace's kitchens by chefs brought from certain parts of the empire to create and experiment with different ingredients. These chefs were tested and hired by their method of cooking rice, a simple dish. They were brought over from various places for the express purpose of experimenting with exotic textures and ingredients and inventing new dishes. [ citation needed ] 
 Each cook specialized in specific tasks. All dishes intended for the sultan were first passed by the palate of the  chesnidjibashi , or imperial food taster, who tested the food for both poison and taste. The creations of the Ottoman palace's kitchens also filtered to the common population, for instance through  Ramadan  events, and through the cooking at the houses ( yalis)  of the pashas, and from there on to the people at large. [ citation needed ] 
 
   Sarma from Turkey 
 Clarified butter  was the favorite cooking fat of the Ottoman Palace. Butter was used for pilafs, sweet pastries, savory  börek , and other dishes. [12]   Olive oil , although used in the palace cooking since the time of  Fatih Sultan Mehmet , was used mostly for lighting lamps and in the manufacture of soaps. [60] [61]  Its use in cuisine was limited, but included stuffed vegetables ( dolma ),  İmam bayıldı ,  Karnıyarık  and  pilaki . [12] 
 Majun ,  compote  and  halva  were sweets made by palace chefs. [17] 
 
 17th century [ edit ] 
   Salep  is a drink made from the tubers of the orchid 
 A palace register from 1692 lists different kinds of vegetables eaten in the palace, squash ( kabak-ı Mısır ), celery, lettuce ( marul ), cucumber, garlic, aubergines, borage ( lisan-ı seveir ), cowpeas, spinach, turnips, vine leaves, Jew's mallow ( müluhiye ), beets, carrots and okra. Parsley, dill, mint, and tarragon are also listed among the foodstuffs allocated for the sultan.  Green tomatoes  ( kavata ) are listed for the  hasseki sultan  (the sultan's favorite concubine), who also received snow for iced  coffee  and to cool  sharbat  and  hoşab . Chicken was reserved for the elite, and pigeon only for the sultan,  hasseki , other potential concubines and princesses. Some large portions allotted to non-imperial high-ranking servants like the female steward of the harem, who received one sheep and 10 chickens per day, indicate that persons in these roles were responsible for feeding their subordinates. [62] 
 Salep  is a drink made from the tubers of the orchid also consumed in this era.
 
 18th century [ edit ] 
 Pepper and cinnamon were the dominant spices of the 18th-century  Ottoman court , used in huge quantities, such as 118 kg (260 lb) of pepper and over 1 kg (2.2 lb) of  mastic  for a 15-day festival attended by various dignitaries in 1720. Black pepper was immensely popular in early modern European cuisine, and was used in nearly all Ottoman dishes. [33] 
 
 19th century [ edit ] 
 Mutton, clarified butter, flour and rice were the most common ingredients in the 19th century palace cuisine. Butter and yogurt, made with milk from Egyptian and Dutch cows, were purchased from the  Üsküdar  and  Eyüp  markets. The most common cheeses were  kaşar ,  kaşkaval ,  tulum peyniri  and  beyaz peynir . Typical spices included cinnamon, clove, saffron, cumin, sumac, nutmeg, oregano, mastic, cardamom and black pepper. [12] 
 Compared with earlier centuries, more fish, roe and caviar were consumed, including the pickled bonito dish called  lakerda . Roe and  Beluga caviar  were even served for the  iftar  meal during Ramadan. Offal meats were more common than lamb meat, which was a seasonal luxury item. More common were  tripe , liver and trotters. Beef was only used in the production of  pastırma  and  sucuk . [12] 
 Starch was used to make the dessert  güllaç  during the month of Ramadan. [12] 
 19th century banquets served a mix of alaturca and alafranga dishes. At an 1856 banquet celebrating Ottoman victory in the  Crimean War  the alaturca dishes were savory börek pastry,  pilaf   and the desserts  kadayıf  and baklava. Some of the dishes given French names were new creations of the palace kitches like  croustade d'ananas en sultane  and  suprême de faisan à la Circassienne . [63]

 Hebron [ edit ] 
 The "Table of Abraham" ( simat al-Khalil ) was a custom of pre-Ottoman  Hebron  to host and feed travelers. According to  Nasir Khusraw , any guest to Hebron received a bowl of lentils with olive oil, and a round loaf of bread and raisins. The  simat  in Hebron, reinstated by the Mamluk sultan  Qaytbay  in the 15th century, was still serving lentils each day in the 16th century. On Thursday evenings  pomegranate  seeds and seasoned rice ( ruzz mufalfal ) were served. According to  Mujir al-Din , all were welcome at the  simat al-Khalil .  Evliya Çelebi , writing in the 17th century, said "each person had his bowl filled with the soup of Abraham, enough for the subsistence of men with their families. I [Evliya] was also fortunately among the group of those poor. I received a plate of wheat soup, a gift from God. I never witness such a tasty meal at the table of either viziers or men of learning". [70] 
 
 Jerusalem [ edit ] 
 At the  Haseki Sultan Imaret  in Jerusalem guests received two bowls of soup each day, enriched with clarified butter, and including legumes, grains, root vegetables and other seasonal ingredients, and always served with bread. On Fridays, and for special occasions like  iftar , Eid celebrations and other holy days like  Aşure ,  Mevlud  and  Berat , lamb and rice would be served instead of soup, and  zerde  (rice pudding with honey and saffron). [70] 
 
 Istanbul [ edit ] 
 All travelers were welcome to three days of basic meals at the  imaret  in  Fatih, İstanbul , but the special service of bread, honey and sweets upon arrival was limited to guests of the  caravansarai  (roadside inn). Two soups were served each day, rice soup in the mornings, and wheat soup in the evenings, similar to the Jerusalem kitchens, but with meat and fresh parsley. The Friday menu was lamb with rice,  zerde , and  zırbaç  (a dessert puddings with dried fruits and nuts). The highest ranking guests ate lamb and rice every day. When members of the  ashraf  were in attendance, they were served  sheep's trotters  ( paça ) for breakfast each day, with hearty lamb and rice portions, and a spiced squash dish sweetened with honey, cloves and cinnamon. 3,300 loaves of bread were baked each day by the kitchens and leftovers distributed to the poor. [70] 
 
 Terminology [ edit ] 
   Manti  of Kayseri 
   Meze  from Turkey 
 The culinary terminology of  Ottoman Turkish  includes many Persian loanwords: [8] 
 
 
 Meze 
 Çorba 
 Hoşaf 
 Reçel 
 Pilaf 
 
 Other culinary terms that have entered the  Turkish language  reveal an assortment of linguistic influences like Italian ( barbunya ), Greek ( fasulye ), Chinese ( manti ) and Arabic ( muhallebi ). [8] 
 Beginning in the 19th century the Ottomans began using French culinary terms at diplomatic events.  French cuisine  was considered, in those times, the epitome of culinary accomplishment and its influence was felt not only in the Ottoman court, but also other European courts, where French chef  Marie-Antoine Carême  cooked in the imperial kitchens of the  Russian Empire , and  Alphonse Gouffe  was Head Pastry Chef to  Queen Victoria . Banquet menus for international dignitaries were written in French and  service à la russe  replaced  service à la française  at formal dinners. Ottoman  pilaf ,  börek  and  kebabs  continued to be served. Food remained a symbol of Ottoman power and prestige and the adaptation of French culinary practices to Ottoman palace cuisine reflected the Ottoman desire to prove themselves the cultural equal of Europeans. [71] 
 Menus of formal banquets at the imperial court dating to the early 20th century show the use of French terms and their Turkish equivalents:

 Legacy [ edit ] 
 Ottoman culinary influence survived the  dissolution of the Ottoman Empire  in Mesopotamia, the Levant, Balkans, Anatolia and Greece.  Hungarian ,  Albanian ,  Greek ,  Romanian ,  Serbian ,  Bulgarian  and  Bosnian cuisine  all share in the heritage of Ottoman culinary culture. Fragner notes that these cuisines, in the modern forms, "offer treacherous circumstantial evidence of this fact" of their shared cultural history, and that the origins of its legacy are impossible to ascertain:
 
 
 It is a matter of mere speculation whether the origins of this imperial culinary legacy are to be traced back to Greek antiquity, the Byzantine heritage, or the Turkish and Arab nations, not forgetting Phoenician traditions; nowadays you may find support for any of these claims in various countries in the Balkans and the Near East. [72] 
 
 
 The collapse of the Ottoman Empire gave rise to the creation of modern nation-states in the Balkans and Middle East. Nationalist ideologies became the tools to forge integrated, shared identities by erasing the shared Ottoman heritage and identity of these many nations. The newly founded states based their national identities on the ancient past (Pharonic, Mesopotamian, Phoenician, Greek). This has made the shared culinary heritage of these nations a flashpoint as competing nationalist agendas have fought over claims to the most prestigious dishes such as baklava. [73]  Fragner notes that the emergent national cuisines also represent "a good deal of local or regional culinary traditions". [74]
