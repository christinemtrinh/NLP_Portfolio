   Indonesia portal   Food portal v t e 
 Balinese cuisine  is a cuisine tradition of  Balinese people  from the volcanic island of  Bali . Using a variety of spices, blended with the fresh vegetables, meat and fish. [1]  Part of  Indonesian cuisine , it demonstrates indigenous traditions, as well as influences from other Indonesian regional cuisine,  Chinese  and  Indian . The island's inhabitants are predominantly  Hindu  and culinary traditions are somewhat distinct with the rest of Indonesia, with festivals and religious celebrations including many special foods prepared as the offerings for the deities, as well as other dishes consumed communally during the celebrations. [2] 
 Rice , the primary grain is almost always consumed as a staple accompanied with vegetables, meat and seafood.  Pork , chicken, fruit, vegetables and seafood are widely utilized, however as in most  Hindu  communities,  beef  is never or rarely consumed. [3] 
 Bali is a popular tourist destination, and the area has many cooking schools with daily courses of Balinese cuisine. [4]   Night markets ,  warungs  (food stands), and fruit vendors sell local delicacies. [4]  Festivals include ornately prepared foods as part of the celebrations. As a popular tourist area, many westernized foods are also available as well.

 Traditions, serving and outlets [ edit ] 
   A  warung  in Bali. 
 In  Hindu Balinese  traditions, certain foodstuffs are served in religious rituals, used as an offering for gods. During religious ceremony, festively decorated fruits and foodstuff are brought to the temple as an offering. Balinese believed that certain foodstuff is an appropriate offering for certain deities. For example, pork is favoured by Batara Kala, while ducks are favoured by Hindu gods, such as Brahma. Certain rare foodstuff such as turtle meat is also used in rituals.
 Balinese households usually purchase fresh ingredients from the local market every morning, cook and serve them in the late morning to be mainly consumed for lunch. The leftovers are stored to be heated again for family dinner. Other than homemade family dishes, Balinese cuisine are served from humble street side carts and  warung s , to fancy restaurants in resorts and five-star hotels. Small family-run  warungs  are the budget options for street food, serving everything from family dishes for full meals, or snack foods.
 Balinese  warungs  or restaurants usually specified on certain menu, for example there are restaurants that specialized on solely serving  babi guling  (suckling pig),  bebek betutu  (crispy duck), or  nasi campur  (Balinese mixed rice). Some  warung  specialized on selling  tipat cantok  (similar to  kupat tahu ) or  nasi jinggo  mixed rice.
 
 Rice [ edit ]

 Bali has a strong  rice agriculture  tradition in Indonesia, as evidence through centuries old intricate network of sophisticated  Subak  irrigation system. The  Balinese water temples  regulates the water allocation of each village's ricefields in the region.  Balinese Hinduism  revered  Dewi Sri  as an important rice goddess. [2]  Her and other deities colorful effigies made from colorful sticky rice are often made during religious ceremonies.
