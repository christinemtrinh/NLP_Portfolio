Liechtensteiner cuisine is the cuisine of Liechtenstein. The cuisine is diverse and has been influenced by the cuisine of nearby countries, particularly Switzerland and Austria,[1][2] and is also influenced by Central European cuisine.[3] Cheeses and soups are integral parts of Liechtensteiner cuisine.[1] Milk products are also commonplace in the country's cuisine, due to an expansive dairy industry.[2] Common vegetables include greens, potatoes and cabbage.[2] Widely consumed meats include beef, chicken and pork.[2] The consumption of three meals a day is commonplace, and meals are often formal.[2]
