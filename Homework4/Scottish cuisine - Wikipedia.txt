 Scottish cuisine  encompasses the cooking styles, traditions and recipes associated with  Scotland . It has distinctive attributes and recipes of its own, but also shares much with  British  and wider  European cuisine  as a result of local, regional, and continental influences—both ancient and modern.
 Scotland's natural larder of vegetables, fruit, oats,  fish  and other seafood, dairy products and  game  is the chief factor in traditional Scottish cooking, with a high reliance on simplicity, without the use of rare, and historically expensive, spices found abroad.
 
 
 History [ edit ] 
 Scotland, with its temperate climate and abundance of indigenous game species, has provided food for its inhabitants for millennia. The wealth of seafood available on and off the coasts provided the earliest settlers with sustenance. Agriculture was introduced, and primitive  oats  quickly became the staple. [1] 
 
 Medieval [ edit ] 
 From the  journeyman  down to the lowest  cottar , meat was an expensive commodity, and would be consumed rarely. For the lower echelons of mediaeval Scots, it was the products of their animals rather than the beasts themselves which provided nourishment.
 This is evident today in traditional Scots fare, with its emphasis on dairy produce. A typical meal in medieval Scotland consisted of a  pottage  of herbs and roots (and when available some meat, usually seafood, or stock for flavouring), with bread and eggs, cheese or kelp when possible. 
 Scotland was a  feudal state  for the greater part of the second millennium. This put certain restrictions on what one was allowed to hunt, therefore to eat. In the halls of the great men of the realm, one could expect  venison ,  boar , various fowl and songbirds, expensive spices ( pepper ,  cloves ,  cinnamon , etc.), and the meats of domesticated species.
 Before  Sir Walter Raleigh 's introduction of the potato to the British Isles, the Scots' main source of  carbohydrate  was bread made from oats or  barley . Wheat was generally difficult to grow because of the damp climate. Food thrift was evident from the earliest times, with excavated  middens  displaying little evidence of anything but the toughest bones. All parts of an animal were used.
 The mobile nature of Scots society required food that should not spoil quickly. It was common to carry a small bag of oatmeal that could be transformed into a basic  porridge  or  oatcakes  using a  girdle  (griddle). It is thought that Scotland's national dish,  haggis , originated in a similar way: A small amount of  offal  or low-quality meat, carried in the most inexpensive bag available, a sheep or pig's stomach. It has also been suggested that this dish was introduced by  Norse  invaders who were attempting to preserve their food during the long journey from  Scandinavia . [2] 
 
 Early Modern period [ edit ] 
 During the  Early Modern period ,  French cuisine  played a role in Scottish cookery due to cultural exchanges brought about by the " Auld Alliance ". [3]  When  Mary, Queen of Scots  returned to Scotland, she brought an entourage of French staff who  revolutionised Scots cooking and created some of Scotland's unique food terminology. These terms include Ashet ( assiette ), a large platter; [4]  Cannel ( cannelle ), cinnamon; Collop ( escalope ); Gigot, French for a leg of mutton; [4]  Howtowdie ( hétoudeau ), a boiling fowl in Old French; [4]  Syboe ( ciboule ), spring onion. [5] 
 
 18th and 19th centuries [ edit ] 
 With the growth of sporting estates and the advent of land enclosure in the 18th century, harvesting Scotland's larder became an industry. The railways further expanded the scope of the market, with Scots  grouse  at a premium (as today) on English menus shortly after the  Glorious Twelfth .
 In the 19th century, Charlotte, Lady Clark of Tillypronie collected recipes throughout her life by asking society hostesses or cooks, and then testing them for herself at Tillypronie ( Aberdeenshire ). These were published posthumously in 1909 as  The Cookery Book of Lady Clark of Tillypronie . [6] [7] [8] [9] 
 
 20th and 21st centuries [ edit ] 
 See also:  Rationing in the United Kingdom 
 The availability of certain foodstuffs in Scotland, in common with the other parts of the United Kingdom, suffered during the 20th century. Rationing during the two World Wars, as well as large-scale industrial agriculture, limited the diversity of food available to the public. Imports from the  British Empire  and beyond did, however, introduce new foods to the Scottish public.
 During the 19th and 20th centuries there was large-scale immigration to Scotland from Italy, and later from the Middle East, India, and Pakistan. These cultures have influenced Scots cooking dramatically. The Italians reintroduced the standard of fresh produce, and the later comers introduced spice. With the enlargement of the  European Union  in the early years of the 21st century, there has been an increase in the population of Eastern European descent, from Poland in particular. A number of speciality restaurants and delicatessens catering for the various new immigrants have opened in the larger towns and cities.

 Restaurants [ edit ] 
 In recent years  Haggis pakoras  have become popular in Indian restaurants. [14] 
 
 Fast food [ edit ] 
 Scotland's reputation for coronary and related diet-based diseases is a result of the wide consumption of fast food since the latter part of the 20th century.  Fish and chip shops  remain extremely popular, and indeed the battered and fried  haggis  supper remains a favourite. In the area around  Edinburgh , the most popular condiment for chip shop meals is "salt and sauce", the sauce element consisting of  brown sauce  thinned with water and vinegar. However in  Glasgow , and elsewhere, chippy sauce is unknown and ketchup or salt and vinegar are preferred, prompting light-hearted debate on the merits of the options among the cities' residents, who tend to find the alternative a baffling concept. [15] [16] [17] [18] 
 Outlets selling  pizzas ,  kebabs ,  pakoras  and other convenience foodstuffs have also become increasingly popular, with an extreme example of this style of food being the  Munchy box . [19] 
 In addition to independent fast-food outlets, in the 1960s American-style burger bars and other restaurants such as  Wimpy  were introduced, and in the 1980s,  McDonald's ,  Burger King ,  Pizza Hut  and  Kentucky Fried Chicken  appeared in Scotland, followed by a large number of  Subway  franchises in the early 21st century. Branches of  Greggs  offering cakes, pastries and sandwiches are also very commonly found on the high streets of Scotland, often alongside smaller competing bakeries.
