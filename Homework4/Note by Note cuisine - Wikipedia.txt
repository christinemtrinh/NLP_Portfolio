 Note by Note cuisine  is a style of cooking based on  molecular gastronomy , created by  Hervé This .  Dishes  are made using  pure compounds  instead of using animal or plant  tissues . Hervé This said the cuisine is like "a painter using primary colours, or a musician composing electroacoustic music, wave by  wave, using a computer". [1] 
 
 
 History [ edit ] 
   Note by Note cuisine was created by Hervé This 
 According to  Hervé This , Note by Note cuisine began in 1994. [1]  In the French edition of  Scientific American , This wrote that he dreamt of the day when  recipes  gave advice like "add to your  bouillon  two drops of a 0.001 percent solution of  benzylmercaptan  in  pure alcohol ". [1] [2]  This said promoting the cuisine was a struggle, between 1994 and 1999 (he gave the name in 1997) and he got no  remuneration  out of it (and even today, he is not selling anything, nor products, or machine, or education). [3]   After 2006, he convinced his friend the French chef  Pierre Gagnaire  to develop Note by Note dishes, and after about one year of work, Pierre Gagnaire served the first Note  by  Note dish ever served in a restaurant. [3]  They presented the first Note by Note dish ("Note à note N°1") in Hong Kong 26 April 2008. [3]  Then, after more common work, Pierre Gagnaire named the second Note by Note dish called "Chick Corea", after the  jazz pianist of the same name . [3] 
 In 2012, This published  La cuisine note à note , where the concept of Note by Note cuisine is discussed. [3] 
 Since the proposal of note by note cooking, This succeeded having many places in world to organize Note by Note dinners of events. For example:

And the menu was the following:
