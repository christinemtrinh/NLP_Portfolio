 The  cuisine of Algeria  is influenced by  Algeria's  interactions and exchanges with other cultures and nations over the centuries. It is characterized by a wealth derived from both land and sea products. Conquests or demographic movement towards the Algerian territory were two of the main factors of exchanges between the different peoples and cultures ( Berbers ,  Arabs ,  Turks ,  Andalusians ,  French , and  Spaniards ). This cuisine is a  Mediterranean  and  North African  cuisine with Berber roots.
 Algerian cuisine offers a variety of dishes depending on the region and the season, but vegetables and  cereals  remain at its core. Most of the Algerian dishes are centered around bread, meats (lamb, beef or poultry), olive oil, vegetables, and fresh herbs. Vegetables are often used for salads, soups,  tajines ,  couscous , and sauce-based dishes. Of all the Algerian traditional dishes available, the most famous one is  couscous , recognized as a national dish.
 
 
 Ingredients [ edit ] 
 Algeria, like other  Maghreb  countries, produces a large range of Mediterranean fruits and vegetables and even some tropical ones. [1]   Lamb  is commonly consumed. Mediterranean seafood and  fish  are also eaten and produced by the little inshore fishing.
 
 Meats [ edit ] 
 Algerians consume a high amount of meat, and it is found in almost every dish.  Mutton  is the most eaten meat in the country. [ citation needed ]

 Poultry  and  beef  are also used—other, more uncommon types of meat such as game, birds and  venison  are considered a delicacy. In the south, dromedary ( camel meat ) is also eaten.
 Meat could traditionally be  dried  in regions such as  Kabylia  as a way to preserve the meat for long amounts of time. [ citation needed ] 
 The  merguez  is a type of sausage originating from the  Berber  people. [2] [3] [4] 
 
 Vegetables [ edit ] 
 Vegetables  that are commonly used include  potatoes  ( batata / betetè ),  carrots  ( zrodiya / sennariya ),  turnip  ( lefft ),  onions  ( bsel / besla ),  tomatoes  ( tomatish / tømètish / t'matem ),  zucchini  ( corget / qar'a  / khyar ),  garlic  ( ethoum ),  cabbages  ( cromb ),  eggplant  ( bidenjan ),  olives  ( zéton ),  pennyroyal  ( fliou ),  cardoon  ( korchef ),  broad bean  ( fool ),  chickpea  ( homoss ), and  chili pepper  ( felfel ).
 Vegetables  are often used in  stews  ( tagine / jwaz / djwizza ) and  soups  ( chorba / harira / jari ) or simply fried or boiled.
 
 Fishes and seafoods [ edit ] 
 Sardines ,  hake ,  shrimps ,  octopus ,  tuna  and  cod  are the main seafoods commonly eaten in Algerian cuisine, mostly in stews or fried.
 
 Spices [ edit ] 
 Many  Spices  are used in Algerian cuisine including for example  dried red   chilli  of different kinds,  caraway ,  cumin ,  cinnamon ,  turmeric ,  ginger ,  paprika ,  coriander ,  saffron ,  mace ,  cloves ,  fennel ,  anise ,  nutmeg , cayenne pepper,  fenugreek , and black pepper.
Some spice mixes are also traditional of the North African region such as the ' ras el hanout  which can be made up to twenty-seven spices. 
 The  hror  is a spice mix typical of Algerian cuisine mainly made from  galangal ,  cubeb ,  nutmeg  and  cinnamon  but recipes may vary and include more spices and herbs such as  liquorice  or  pellitory . [ citation needed ]

 Starters and appetizers [ edit ] 
 Some small starters can be eaten either before the main dish (traditionally done during  Ramadan ). These starters are generally soups (most famously  chorba ) but also include  kemia , some small dish of  offal  (such as  liver  or  kidneys ) or  carrots  with  cumin  ( zorodiyya mcharmla ). Some traditional salads such as  chlata felfel  (a salad of roasted/smoked  peppers ,  tomatoes ,  onions  or  scallions  and  garlic  with  olive oil  and  vinegar , generallly served cold),  zaalouka  ( ratatouille  of eggplants and tomatoes mainly, served hot or cold) or salads made with  beets ,  corn ,  cucumber ,  tomatoes  and  eggs  can also be served before a meal.
 
 Main dishes [ edit ] 
 A common and one of the most favorite dishes of Algerian cuisine is  couscous ,. [5]  The semolina is traditionally made from wheat but can also be made with barley. The grains can also be fermented to make  el Hammoun  couscous. [6]  The dish can be prepared in many ways, generally with a sauce with  beef  or [[Lamb and mutton
|lamb]] and  zucchini ,  carrots ,  chickpeas  and  green bean ,  chicken ,  lentils  and  black-eyed pea . Couscous can also be consumed in a  masfouf  (or thameqfoult in Kabyle), a dry version with no sauce and vegetables such as  broad beans ,  peas  or also with  raisins  and  dates , traditionally along with fermented milk.
 Several pasta dishes can be found in the traditional Algerian cuisine:  rechta ,  chakhchoukha ,  berkoukes ,  tikourbabine  (also called  asban ),  Aftir oukessoul [7]   tlitli  or  trida . [8]  These traditional pasta dishes are prepared in a red stew, with the exception of rechta which is generally made in a white stew in Algeria, with meat and vegetables.
 Vegetarian dishes in Algeria are also a main part of the diet with  karantita  ( chickpeas   flan ),  tbikha  (vegetable stew),  shakshouka  (sort of  ratatouille , often cooked with  eggs ),  zaalouka  ( ratatouille  of eggplants and tomatoes mainly, served hot or cold). These dishes are often consumed with bread.
 Tajine  or  djouez  are traditional dishes prepared in a stew or cooked in a similar way, originally in an  earthen pot . They can be vegetarian, but are generally made of a meat (either lamb or chicken) and vegetables. Particular  tajines  made in a red sauce are called  chtitha  (for example  chtitha djaj  is a chicken dish cooked in a red sauce with chickpeas). Other famous dishes include  Koubeb  (chicken cooked in a white sauce with  cinnamon  and  chickpeas  and served with thick  fries  and parsley),  zviti ,  marqa bel a'assel  (a speciality from  Tlemcen ).
 Some additional dishes include:
 
   Tchektchouka 
 Bourek —fried spring rolls with various stuffing, including meat, tuna, potato, and cheese. A popular variant, the  bourek annabi , from  Annaba  is bigger and stuffed with  mashed potatoes ,  ground   beef meat ,  mushrooms ,  cheese ,  eggs  and  parsley . 
 Mhadjeb —flat bread stuffed with onions and tomato sauce. 
 Shakshouka ,  chakshoka ,  shakhshosha —a mixture of onions, tomato, bell peppers, zucchini and eggs. There many versions, depending on the region.

 Soups [ edit ] 
 Algeria has four well-known traditional soups consumed throughout the country:  chorba frik  (which is also cooked with  kadaif  in some regions in place of the  frik ),  harira ,  djari  and  tchicha . These traditional Algerian soups are served at the beginning of the meal as an entree and are mainly prepared from lamb, mutton or chicken, chickpeas, tomatoes, vermicelli, wheat, spices and different vegetables and legumes. These varied soups are the most popular during the holy month of Ramadan. The  gaspacho oranais  is an Algerian version of a  Manchego  dish. [9]  The  chorba  has another variant, the  chorba bida  (white chorba) which is cooked with chicken,  kadaif , chickpeas and pasley without any tomato. It is traditionally eaten with a squeeze of lemon juice.
 
 Desserts [ edit ] 
   Algerian  Baklawa

 Typically, seasonal fruits served as a dessert at the end of meals. These fruits include  watermelon ,  loquat ,  grape ,  pomegranate  or  dates  (which can also be served at the beginning of the meal).
 Common  pastries  include  dziriyat ,  garn ghzal  (similar to  Gazelle ankles ,  baqlawa ,  bradj ,  makroudh ,  kalb elouz ,   zlabiya , and  griwech  (a deep-fried pretzel-shaped dough, soaked in honey and sprinkled with sesame seeds).
 Many pastries are prepared for special occasions like for  Eid-al-fitr  and weddings. For example, the  mouna  was traditionally served by newlywed women to other women during their traditional  hammam . The  tamina  is a kind of paste made with  semolina ,  butter ,  hror  or other spices and  honey  usually served after a woman gave birth.
 msemen ,  sfenj  or  baghrir  are generally served with tea and can be topped with honey, jam or even olive oil and sugar.
 Creponne , a  sorbet  which originated in  Oran , is a specialty in Algeria. [10]  Other desserts and cakes such as  sfenj  and  kroki   mchawcha  are also commonly eaten.
 
 Drinks [ edit ] 
 Green tea  with  mint  is generally drunk in the afternoon and during ceremonies with pastries. [11]  When fresh mint is not available, dried leaves can be used instead.  Geranium tea  can also be prepared with  geranium  leaves instead of  mint . Generally, tea is prepared with green tea leaves, either of the  gunpowder blend  or  chaara sandook  (green tea with a lighter taste han the bitter gunpowder blend).
 Algerians are heavy  coffee  consumers; thick espresso and black coffee are very popular, Algerian breakfast consists of a latte coffee with  croissants  or bread with butter or any Algerian sweets like  Algerian baklawa ,  msemen  or  baghrir  topped with honey or jam.  Mazagran  which is said to be the “original iced coffee” originated in Algeria, it is a cold sweetened coffee drink. [12] [13] 
 Sherbet mazhar  is a traditional beverage drunk during marriages in the northern parts of the country. It is a  syrup  made with water, sugar and  orange flower water  ( mazhar ). [8]   Sherbet Miliana  is another traditional  syrup  made from  cherries  originating from  Miliana .
 Fruit juice and soft drinks, called  gazouz , are common and often drunk daily, the most famous Algerian soda is  Hamoud Boualem , an Algerian  soft drink  manufacturer that makes drinks popular in Algeria and exports them abroad, primarily for consumption by Algerian emigrants. It is one of the country's oldest companies, having been founded in 1878. Their products include sodas like "Selecto," "Hamoud," and "Slim", each in multiple flavors, as well as syrups in different flavors. [14] 
 Algeria previously produced a large quantity of  Algerian wine  during the  French colonization  but production has decreased since its independence; Alcohol consumption is frowned upon in Algeria but is not legally prohibited, which does not prevent the winegrower from producing a wide variety of wines mainly from the slopes of Mascara, Médéa and Tlemcen. [15] 
 
 Sauces and condiments [ edit ] 
 Algerian cuisine is characterized by its use of flavorful spices and herbs, and a variety of sauces play an important role in many dishes. Two popular Algerian sauces are harissa and dersa.
 Harissa  is a spicy chili paste that is made from dried chili peppers, garlic, olive oil, and various spices such as cumin and coriander. It is often used as a condiment to add heat and flavor to stews, soups, and grilled meats. Harissa can also be used as a marinade for meat or seafood.
 Dersa  is a milder sauce that is made from garlic, lemon juice, olive oil, and a variety of herbs such as parsley, cilantro, and mint. It is often used as a dipping sauce for bread, vegetables, or grilled meats. Dersa can also be used as a marinade or dressing for salads.
 Zaalouk: a traditional dip used in Algeria made from eggplant, tomatoes, garlic, and spices, typically served as an appetizer or side dish.
 Chermoula , a marinade made from garlic, cilantro, lemon juice, and spices, commonly used to flavor seafood and meat dishes.
 Toum: a garlic sauce made from garlic, lemon juice, and olive oil, similar to aioli, often served with grilled meats or as a dip.
 Shakshuka sauce : a spicy tomato sauce made with onions, peppers, and a variety of spices, often used in the popular egg dish of the same name.
 Hmiss  is another popular condiment in Algerian cuisine. It is a spicy tomato sauce made from roasted red peppers, tomatoes, garlic, olive oil, and chili peppers. Hmiss is usually served as a dip or spread with bread or grilled meat, and it can also be used as a topping for sandwiches or pizza. The roasted red peppers give hmiss a smoky flavor, while the chili peppers add heat, making it a flavorful and spicy condiment. In some parts of Algeria, hmiss is also made with the addition of spices such as cumin and paprika, giving it a unique regional variation. Hmiss is a versatile sauce that adds a delicious kick to many dishes, and it is a favorite condiment among Algerians.
 
 Bread [ edit ] 
 Between 1976 and 1984, the average Algerian family spent around 56% of their income on food and drink, and more than 10% of that number was spent on  bread  and other cereal products. Bread is thought to contain God's blessing,  baraka . It is traditionally seen as a symbol of life and functions in rituals symbolic of life, fertility and abundance. [16] 
 
 Types of breads [ edit ] 
   Algerian bread 
 Khubz as-dâr —wheat flour, water, salt and yeast. Traditionally flat and round, a few centimeters thick, made at home and commonly baked in a gas oven or communal oven.
 Khubz at-tajîn  or  matlû —wheat semolina, yeast, water and salt. Flattened pan-bread (French:  galette ), baked in a previously heated earthenware or cast-iron plate on a fire.  Variations are made by the quality of the leavening agent, by adding barley or sorghum, bran, or by making it corn-based.
 Khubz-ftir ,  raqâq ,  rfîs  or  tarîd —well-kneaded, unleavened dough, baked for half a minute on a convex sheet of brass or iron, balanced on stones over a fire. This is a preferred method for those living nomadic lives due to easy transportation of pan and little amount of fuel necessary.
 Batbout  is a small bread resembling Greek  pita bread , albeit thicker (similar to  matlû ). It is eaten with stuffing inside.
 French  baguettes —white, leavened wheat flour. Bought at bakery or street vendor, but never made at home due to access to mills powered by electricity. Power shortages prevent consumption of this bread, and often Algerians turn to home-made breads that are milled by women's hands. [16] 
 
 Algerian bread [ edit ] 
 French bread tends to be given more value in terms of taste and quality in that it was commonly associated to being more suitable to higher standards. However, the white inner parts of a baguette are thought to be unhealthy and will regularly be thrown away, and the bread is frequently associated with constipation.
 Algerian breads, on the other hand, are considered more nutritive, rich and tasteful and seldom go to waste. Because French breads harden over night or become chewy when put away in plastic bags, it is hard to find usage for them, so they are thrown away with more frequency than Algerian breads that can be reheated or reutilized as edible food utensils or even bird feed.
 In the context of rituals, only Algerian bread is thought suitable. Breads offered to guests should be homemade, as it signifies the essence, intimacy, and qualities of the family. In daily practices, it is also a sign of wealth and affluence if one has extra bread at the table, and making bread at home can be considered a sign of familial economic independence. [16] 
 Commonly eaten breads in Algeria consist of Kesra, Matlouh, Mtabga and Mouna.
