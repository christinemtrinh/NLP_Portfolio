 Bosnia and Herzegovina  cuisine  ( Bosnian :  Bosanska kuhinja ) is balanced between  Western  and  Eastern  influences. The food is closely related to former Yugoslav,  Middle Eastern ,  Mediterranean ,  Austo-Hungarian  and other  Balkan  cuisines.
 
 
 Ingredients [ edit ] 
 Bosnian cuisine uses many  spices , but usually in moderate quantities. Most dishes are light, as they are cooked in lots of water; the sauces are fully natural, consisting of little more than the natural juices of the vegetables in the dish. Typical ingredients include  tomatoes ,  potatoes ,  onions ,  garlic ,  bell peppers ,  cucumbers ,  carrots ,  cabbage ,  mushrooms ,  spinach ,  courgette , dried and fresh beans,  plums ,  milk ,  paprika  and cream called  pavlaka  and  kajmak . Typical meat dishes include primarily beef and  lamb  due to  Islamic dietary laws , although the  Bosnian Croats  and  Bosnian Serbs  can consume pork. Some local specialties are  ćevapi ,  burek ,  dolma ,  sarma ,  pilav  ( pilaf ),  gulaš  ( goulash ),  ajvar  and a whole range of Eastern sweets. The best local wines come from  Herzegovina  where the climate is suitable for growing grapes. Plum or apple  rakija , is produced in  Bosnia .
