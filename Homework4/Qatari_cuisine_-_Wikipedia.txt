Qatari cuisine is made up of traditional Arab cuisine.[1] MachbÅ«s, a meal consisting of rice, meat, and vegetables, is the national dish in Qatar, typically made with either lamb or chicken and slow-cooked to give it a depth of flavour.[2][1] Seafood and dates are staple food items in the country.[3] Many of these dishes are also used in other countries in the region, because they share many commonalities. In other parts of the region some of the dishes have different names or use slightly different ingredients.[4] One proponent of the importance of Qatar's culinary heritage is chef Noor Al Mazroei, who adapts traditional recipes to include vegan and gluten-free alternatives.[5]

Cooks will make sure to purchase best-quality spices and to make sure not to overbuy to preserve their freshness.[6] Bizar is a combination of black pepper, coriander seeds, cinnamon sticks, clove, dried ginger, whole cardamom, dried red chili, and turmeric sticks.
