   A typical Jordanian breakfast:  hummus ,  falafel , salad, pickles and  khubz  ( pita ) 
 Jordanian cuisine  is a  Middle Eastern cuisine  that has the traditional style of  food preparation  originating from, or commonly used in,  Jordan  that has developed through centuries of social and political change.
 There are a wide variety of techniques used in Jordanian cuisine ranging from  baking ,  sautéeing  and  grilling  to stuffing of  vegetables  (courgettes, capsicum, eggplants, etc.).  Meat  is an important component of Jordanian cuisine. The most common types of meat in Jordan are  lamb ,  beef , chicken and sometimes  goat  and camel meat. Also common in Jordanian cuisine is  roasting  or preparing foods with special sauces.
 Rice plays an important role in Jordanian cuisine. It is commonly served as a side dish to main meals, but there are also plenty of one-pot rice dishes such as  maqloubah . [1] 
 As one of the largest producers of  olives  in the world, [2]   olive oil  is the main cooking oil in  Jordan .  Herbs ,  garlic ,  onion ,  tomato sauce  and  lemon  are typical flavors found in Jordan. 
 The blend of spices called  za'atar [3]  contains a common local herb called  sumac [4]  that grows wild in Jordan and is closely identified with Jordanian and other Middle Eastern countries. 
 Yogurt  is commonly served alongside food and is a common ingredient itself; in particular,  jameed , a form of dried yogurt is unique to Jordanian cuisine and a main ingredient in  mansaf [5] [6]  the national dish of  Jordan , [7] [8]  and a symbol in Jordanian culture for generosity.
 Another famous meat dish in Jordan is  zarb . [9]  It is especially popular in areas inhabited by  Bedouin  tribes such as  Petra  and the desert of  Wadi Rum  where it is commonly served to tourists. [10]  Zarb is prepared in a submerged oven called a  taboon , and is considered a delicacy. It consists of a selection of meat (usually chicken and lamb), vegetables (zucchini, eggplant, carrots, potatoes) and is served with rice and various meze, such as tabbouleh salad. [11] 
 Internationally known foods which are common and popular everyday snacks in Jordan include  hummus , which is a purée of  chick peas  blended with  tahini , lemon, and garlic, and  falafel , a deep-fried ball or patty made from ground chickpeas. 
 A typical  mezze  includes foods such as  kibbeh ,  labaneh ,  baba ghanoush ,  tabbouleh ,  olives  and  pickles .  Bread ,  rice ,  freekeh  and  bulgur  all have a role in Jordanian cuisine.
 Popular desserts include  baklava ,  knafeh ,  halva  and  qatayef  (a dish made specially for  Ramadan ), in addition to seasonal fruits such as  watermelons ,  figs  and  cactus pear  which are served in summer. [12] 
 Turkish coffee  and  tea  flavored with  mint  or  sage  are almost ubiquitous in Jordan.  Arabic coffee  is also usually served on more formal occasions. [13] 
 
 
 Food culture and traditions [ edit ] 
 Jordanian cuisine is a part of  Levantine cuisine  and shares many traits and similarities with the cuisine of  Lebanon ,  Palestine  and  Syria , often with some local variations. More generally Jordanian cuisine is influenced by historical connections to the cuisine of  Turkey  and the former  Ottoman Empire . Jordanian cuisine is also influenced by the cuisines of groups who have made a home for themselves in modern Jordan, including  Armenians ,  Circassians ,  Iraqis ,  Palestinians , and  Syrians . [14] [15] 
 Food is a very important aspect of  Jordanian culture . In villages, meals are a community event with immediate and extended family present. In addition, food is commonly used by Jordanians to express their hospitality and generosity. Jordanians serve family, friends, and guests with great pride in their homes, no matter how modest their means. A "Jordanian invitation" means that one is expected to bring nothing and eat everything.
 Celebrations in  Jordan  are marked with dishes from Jordanian cuisine spread out and served to the guests.  Customs such as  weddings , birth of a child, funerals, birthdays and specific religious and national ceremonies such as  Ramadan  and  Jordan 's independence day all call for splendid food to be served to guests. To celebrate the birth of a child,  karawiya , a caraway-flavoured pudding, is commonly served to guests.
