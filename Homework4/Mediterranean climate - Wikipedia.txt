   Regions with Mediterranean climates     Hot-summer mediterranean climate ( Csa )      Warm-summer mediterranean climate ( Csb ) 
 A  Mediterranean climate  ( / ˌ m ɛ d ɪ t ə ˈ r eɪ n i ə n /   MED -i-tə- RAY -nee-ən ), also called a  dry summer climate , described by  Köppen  as  Cs , is a climate type that occurs in the lower mid-latitudes (normally 30 to 44 north and south latitude), characterized by warm to hot, dry summers and mild, fairly wet winters; these weather conditions are typically experienced in the majority of Mediterranean-climate regions and countries, but remain highly dependent on proximity to the ocean, altitude and geographical location. 
 The dry summer climate is found throughout the warmer  middle latitudes , affecting almost exclusively the western portions of continents in relative proximity to the coast. The  climate  type's name is in reference to the coastal regions of the  Mediterranean Sea , which mostly share this type of climate, but it can also be found in the Atlantic portions of  Iberia  and Northwest Africa, the Pacific portions of the United States and Chile, areas around  Cape Town, South Africa , parts of  Southwest  and  South Australia  and parts of Central Asia.
 Mediterranean  climate zones  are typically located along the western coasts of landmasses, between roughly 30 and 45 degrees north or south of the  equator . The main cause of Mediterranean, or dry summer, climate is the  subtropical ridge , extending towards the hemisphere in question’s pole during the summer and migrating towards the equator during the winter. This is due to the seasonal poleward-equatorward variations of temperatures. [1] 
 The resulting  vegetation  of Mediterranean climates are the  garrigue  or  maquis  in the European Mediterranean Basin, the  chaparral  in California, the  fynbos  in South Africa, the  mallee  in Australia, and the  matorral  in Chile. Areas with this climate are also where the so-called "Mediterranean trinity" of major agricultural crops have traditionally been successfully grown ( wheat ,  grapes  and  olives ). As a result, these regions are notable for their high-quality wines, grapeseed/olive oils, and bread products. [2] 
 Most of the historically-iconic cities and regions of the Mediterranean Basin lie within the Mediterranean climatic zone, including  Algiers ,  Athens ,  Barcelona ,  Beirut ,  İzmir ,  Jerusalem ,  Marseille ,  Monaco ,  Naples ,  Rome ,  Tunis ,  Valencia , and  Valletta . Locations with Mediterranean climates outside of the Mediterranean Basin include  Adelaide ,  Cape Town ,  Casablanca ,  Dushanbe ,  Lisbon ,  Los Angeles ,  Perth ,  Porto ,  San Diego ,  San Francisco ,  Santiago ,  Tashkent  and  Victoria . [3] 
 
 
 Köppen climate classification [ edit ] 
   Continental Portugal has a clear contrast between the cool to warm ( Csb ) and hot ( Csa ) summers. 
 Under the  Köppen climate classification , "hot dry-summer" climates (classified as  Csa ) and "cool dry-summer" climates (classified as  Csb ) are often referred to as just "Mediterranean". Under the Köppen climate system, the first letter indicates the climate group (in this case temperate climates). Temperate climates or " C " zones average temperature above 0 °C (32 °F) (or −3 °C (27 °F)), but below 18 °C (64 °F), in their coolest months. The second letter indicates the precipitation pattern (" s " represents dry summers). Köppen has defined a dry summer month as a month with less than 30 mm (1.2 in) of precipitation and as a month within the high-sun months of April to September, in the case of the Northern Hemisphere and October to March, in the case of the Southern Hemisphere, and it also must contain exactly or less than one-third that of the wettest winter month. Some, however, use a 40 mm (1.6 in) level. [4] [5]  The third letter indicates the degree of summer heat: " a " represents an average temperature in the warmest month above 22 °C (72 °F), while " b " indicates the average temperature in the warmest month below 22 °C (72 °F). There is a "c" with 3 or less months' average temperature above 10 °C (50 °F), but this climate is rare and is very isolated.
 Under the Köppen classification, dry-summer climates ( Csa ,  Csb ) usually occur on the western sides of continents.  Csb  zones in the Köppen system include areas normally not associated with Mediterranean climates but with  Oceanic  climates, such as much of the  Pacific Northwest , much of southern  Chile , parts of west-central  Argentina , and parts of  New Zealand . [6]  Additional highland areas in the subtropics also meet  Cs  requirements, though they, too, are not normally associated with Mediterranean climates. The same goes for a number of  oceanic islands  such as  Madeira , the  Juan Fernández Islands , the western part of the  Canary Islands , and the eastern part of the  Azores .
 Under  Trewartha 's modified Köppen climate classification, the two major requirements for a  Cs  climate are revised. Under Trewartha's system, at least eight months must have average temperatures of 10 °C (50 °F) or higher ( subtropical ), and the average annual precipitation must not exceed 900 mm (35 in). Normally, climates that have eight or more months with a mean temperature over 10 °C (50 °F), are located in the low and  subtropical  latitude portions of the temperate zone (latitudes 25 to 35 north and south), and have mean temperatures around 7 °C (45 °F) in the coldest months, and warmer than 22 °C (72 °F) in the warmest months. In the Trewartha climate classification system, the cooler summer  Csb  zones in the Köppen system become  Do  or temperate  oceanic climate .
 Under the  Holdridge life zones  classification, the Mediterranean climates can be either temperate or subtropical climates. They are frequently found within the Warm Temperate region as defined by  Leslie Holdridge  with a mean annual  biotemperature  between 12 °C (54 °F) and the frost line or critical temperature line, 16 to 18 °C (61 to 64 °F) (depending on locations in the world [7]  but often "simplified" as 17 °C (63 °F) (= 2 (log 2 12+0;5)  ≈ 16.97 °C (62.55 °F)) [8] ). Biotemperature is based on the growing season length and temperature. It is measured as the mean of all temperatures, with all temperatures below freezing and above 30 °C (86 °F) adjusted to 0 °C, [9]  as plants are normally dormant at these temperatures. The frost line separates the warm temperate region from the subtropical region. It represents the dividing line between two major physiological groups of evolved plants. On the warmer side of the line, the majority of the plants are sensitive in low temperatures. They can be killed back by frosts as they have not evolved to withstand periods of cold. On the colder temperate side of the line, the total  flora  is adapted to survive periods of variable lengths of low temperatures, whether as seeds in the case of the annuals or as perennial plants which can withstand the cold. Only the warmest Mediterranean climates with a biotemperature between 16 °C (61 °F) to 18 °C (64 °F) and 24 °C (75 °F) are classified as subtropical climates in the Holdridge classification.

 [Chile] has six, months of winter, no more, and in them, except when there is a quarter moon when it rains one or two days, all the other days have such beautiful suns... —  Pedro de Valdivia to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor 
 During summer, regions of the Mediterranean climate are strongly influenced by the subtropical ridge which keeps atmospheric conditions very dry with minimal cloud coverage. In some areas, such as coastal  California , the cold  current  has a stabilizing effect on the surrounding air, further reducing the chances for rain, but often causing thick layers of marine  fog  that usually evaporates by mid-day. Similar to  desert  climates, in many Mediterranean climates there is a strong  diurnal  character to daily temperatures in the warm summer months due to strong solar heating during the day from sunlight and rapid cooling at night.
 In winter, the subtropical ridge migrates towards the equator and leaves the area, making rainfall much more likely. As a result, areas with this climate receive almost all of their precipitation during their winter and spring seasons, and may go anywhere from four to six months during the summer and early fall without having any significant  precipitation . In the lower latitudes, precipitation usually decreases in both the winter and summer due to higher  evapotranspiration . Toward the polar latitudes, total moisture usually increases; for instance, the Mediterranean climate in  Southern Europe  has more rain. The rainfall also tends to be more evenly distributed throughout the year in Southern Europe, while in places such as the  Eastern Mediterranean , or in  Southern California , the summer is nearly or completely dry. In places where  evapotranspiration  is higher, steppe climates tend to prevail, but still follow the basic pattern of the Mediterranean climates.

 The majority of the regions with Mediterranean climates have relatively mild winters and very warm summers. However, winter and summer temperatures can vary greatly between different regions with a Mediterranean climate. For instance, in the case of winters,  Los Angeles  experiences mild to warm temperatures in the winter, with frost and snowfall almost unknown, whereas  Tashkent  has cold winters with annual frosts and snowfall seen in the winter; or, to consider summer,  Seville  experiences rather high temperatures in that season. In contrast,  San Francisco  has cool summers with daily highs around 21 °C (70 °F) due to the continuous  upwelling  of cold subsurface waters along the coast.
 Because most regions with a Mediterranean climate are near large bodies of water,  temperatures  are generally moderate, with a comparatively small range of temperatures between the winter low and summer high unlike dry-summer  humid continental climates  (although the daily diurnal range of temperature during the summer is large due to dry and clear conditions, except along the immediate coastlines). Temperatures during winter only occasionally fall below the freezing point and  snow  is generally seldom seen. Summer temperatures can be cool to very hot, depending on the distance from a large body of water, elevation, and latitude, among other factors. Strong winds from inland desert regions can sometimes boost summer temperatures up, quickly increasing the risk of  wildfires . Notable exceptions to the usual proximity from bodies of water, thus featuring extremely high summer temperatures and cooler winters, include south-eastern Turkey and northern Iraq ( Urfa ,  Erbil ), surrounded by hot deserts to the south and mountains to the north. Those places routinely experience summer daily means of over 30 °C (86 °F), while receiving enough rainfall in winter not to fall into  arid  or  semi-arid  classifications.
 As in every  climatologic  domain, the highland locations of the Mediterranean domain can present cooler temperatures in the summer and winter than the lowland areas, temperatures which can sometimes prohibit the growth of typical cold-sensitive Mediterranean plants. Some Spanish authors opt in to use the term  Continental Mediterranean Climate  for some regions with lower temperatures in winter than the coastal areas [10]  (direct translation from  Clima Mediterráneo Continentalizado ), but most climate classifications (including Köppen's  Cs  zones) show no distinction as long as winter temperature means stay above freezing.
 Additionally, the temperature and rainfall pattern for a  Csa  or even a  Csb  climate can exist as a  microclimate  in some high-altitude locations adjacent to a rare tropical  As  ( tropical savanna climate  with dry summers, typically in a  rainshadow  region, as in Hawaii).
These have a favourable climate, with mild wet winters and fairly warm, dry summers.
 
 Mediterranean biome [ edit ]

   Makarska  in  Dalmatia , Croatia 
   The coastal Mediterranean region of  Costa Brava ,  Catalonia ,  Spain 
 The  Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub   biome  is closely associated with Mediterranean climate zones, as are unique freshwater communities, though vegetation native to the Mediterranean climate zone can also be found in the approximate nearby climate zones, which usually tend to be the  humid subtropical ,  oceanic  and/or  semi-arid  zones, depending on the region and location. Particularly distinctive of the climate are  sclerophyll  shrublands, called  maquis  in the Mediterranean Basin,  chaparral  in California,  matorral  in Chile,  fynbos  in South Africa, and  mallee  and  kwongan  shrublands in Australia.
 Aquatic communities in Mediterranean climate regions are adapted to a yearly cycle in which  abiotic  (environmental) controls of stream populations and community structure dominate during floods,  biotic components  (e.g. competition and predation) controls become increasingly important as the flood discharge declines, and environmental controls regain dominance as environmental conditions become very harsh (i.e. hot and dry); as a result, these communities are well suited to recover from  droughts ,  floods , and  fires . [11]  Aquatic organisms in these regions show distinct long-term patterns in their structure and function, [3]  and are also highly sensitive to the recent  effects of climate change . [1] [2] 
 
 Natural vegetation [ edit ] 
 The native vegetation of Mediterranean climate lands must be adapted to survive long, hot summer droughts in summer and prolonged wet periods in winter. Mediterranean vegetation examples include the following: [12] 
 
 Evergreen trees:  bay laurel ,  eucalyptus ,  grevillea ,  casuarina ,  melaleuca ,  pine , and  cypress 
 Deciduous trees:  sycamore ,  oak , and  buckeyes 
 Fruit trees:  olive ,  figs ,  walnuts  and  grapes 
 Shrubs:  rosemary ,  Erica ,  Banksia , and  chamise 
 Sub-shrubs:  lavender ,  Halimium , and  sagebrush 
 Grasses:  grassland types ,  Themeda triandra ,  bunchgrasses ;  sedges , and  rushes 
 Herbs:  Achillea ,  Dietes ,  Helichrysum  and  Penstemon 
 Many native vegetations in Mediterranean climate area valleys have been cleared for  agriculture  and farming. In places such as the  Sacramento Valley  and  Oxnard Plain  in  California , draining marshes and estuaries combined with supplemental irrigation has led to a century of intensive agriculture. Much of the  Overberg  in the southern Cape of  South Africa , was once covered with  renosterveld , but has likewise been largely converted to agriculture, mainly for  wheat . In hillside and mountainous areas, away from the  urban sprawls , ecosystems and habitats of native vegetation are more sustained and undisturbed.
 The  fynbos  vegetation in the South-western Cape in South Africa is famed for its high floral  diversity , and includes such plant types as members of the  Restionaceae ,  Ericas  (Heaths) and  Proteas . Representatives of the  Proteaceae  also grow in Australia, such as  Banksias . The palette of  California native plants  is also renowned for its  species  and  cultivar  diversity.

      Hot-summer mediterranean climate ( Csa ) 
 This subtype of the Mediterranean climate ( Csa ) is the most common form of the Mediterranean climate, therefore it is also known as a "typical Mediterranean climate". As stated earlier, regions with this form of a Mediterranean climate experience average monthly temperatures in excess of 22.0 °C (71.6 °F) during its warmest month and an average in the coldest month between 18 and −3 °C (64 and 27 °F) or, in some applications, between 18 and 0 °C (64 and 32 °F). Also, at least four months must average above 10 °C (50 °F) to avoid becoming a cold mediterranean subtype. Regions with this form of the Mediterranean climate typically experience hot, sometimes very hot and dry summers and mild, wet winters. In a number of instances, summers here can closely resemble summers seen in  arid  and  semi-arid climates  and be close to the thresholds for them. However, high temperatures during summers are generally not quite as high as those in arid or semiarid climates due to the presence of a large body of water nearby. All areas with this subtype have wet mild winters. However, some areas with a hot Mediterranean subtype can actually experience very chilly winters, with occasional snowfall.
 Csa  climates are mainly found around the  Mediterranean Sea , southern Australia, southwestern  South Africa , sections of  Central Asia , northern sections of  Iran  and  Iraq , the interior of northern  California  west of the  Sierra Nevada , along the  Wasatch Front  in  Utah , and inland areas of southern  Oregon  west of the  Cascade Mountains . Southern California's coasts also experience hot summers due to the shielding effect of the  Channel Islands . However, unshielded areas of that coastline can have warm-summer Mediterranean climates with hot-summer areas just a few kilometres inland.

 Warm-summer Mediterranean climate [ edit ] 
      Warm-summer mediterranean climate ( Csb ) 
 Occasionally also termed the "Cool-summer Mediterranean climate", this subtype of the Mediterranean climate ( Csb ) is less common and experience warm (but not hot) and dry summers, with no average monthly temperatures above 22 °C (72 °F) during its warmest month and as usual an average in the coldest month between 18 and −3 °C (64 and 27 °F) or, [ citation needed ]  in some applications, between 18 and 0 °C (64 and 32 °F). [ citation needed ] 
 Also, at least four months must average above 10 °C (50 °F) once again.
 Cool ocean currents, upwelling and higher  latitudes  are often the reason for this cooler type of Mediterranean climate. This is why it rarely occurs on the Mediterranean Sea shores, as it is a warm sea and is subtropical, from 3 to 6 °C above the theoric value according to Jean Demangeot. [15] 
 The other main reason for this cooler type is the  altitude . For instance,  Menton  on the French coast has a Csa climate while  Castellar, Alpes-Maritimes , the adjacent town just north of Menton, with an altitude between 100 and 1,382 m (328 and 4,534 ft), has a Csb climate instead. [16] 
 Winters are rainy and can be mild to chilly. In some instances, snow can fall on these areas.
 Precipitation occurs often in the colder seasons, but there are a number of clear sunny days even during the wetter seasons.
 Csb  climates are found in northwestern  Iberian Peninsula  (namely  Galicia  and the  Norte region  and west coast of  Portugal ), in coastal  California , in the  Pacific Northwest  (namely western  Washington , western  Oregon  and southern portions of  Vancouver Island  in  British Columbia ), [17] [18] [19] [20] [21]  in central  Chile , in parts of southern  Australia  and in sections of southwestern  South Africa . A few locations close to the south coast of  England  such as  Weymouth and Portland  just scrape into this climate classification due to very low rainfall in July. A trend towards slightly drier summers during the 1971-2000 climate average period, meant that this classification previously extended slightly further to include a few other weather stations in southern England, such as  Bognor Regis  and  Teignmouth . [22]  Rarer instances of this climate can be found in relatively small and isolated high altitude areas of the Andes in Northern  Ecuador ,  Colombia , and Western  Venezuela .

 Cold-summer Mediterranean climate [ edit ] 
   Distribution of the relatively rare cold-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen type  Csc ) in Washington, Oregon and California 
 The cold-summer subtype of the Mediterranean climate ( Csc ) is rare and predominately found at scattered high-altitude locations along the west coasts of North and South America having a similar climate. [ citation needed ]  This type is characterized by cool, dry summers, with less than four months with a mean temperature at or above 10 °C (50 °F), as well as with cool, wet winters, with no winter month having a mean temperature below 0 °C (32 °F) (or −3 °C [27 °F]), depending on the isotherm used). [ citation needed ]  Regions with this climate are influenced by the dry-summer trend (though briefly)  that extends considerably poleward along the west coast of the Americas, as well as the moderating influences of high altitude and relative proximity to the Pacific Ocean, thus maintaining a narrow temperature range through the year.
 In North America, areas with  Csc  climate can be found in the  Olympic ,  Cascade ,  Klamath , and  Sierra Nevada  ranges in Washington, Oregon and California. These locations are found at high altitude nearby lower altitude regions characterized by a warm-summer Mediterranean climate ( Csb ) or hot-summer Mediterranean climate ( Csa ). A rare instance of this climate occurs in the tropics, on  Haleakalā Summit  in Hawaii.
 In South America,  Csc  regions can be found along the  Andes  in Chile and Argentina. The town of  Balmaceda, Chile  is one of the few towns confirmed to have this climate.
 Small areas with a  Csc  climate can be found at high elevations in  Corsica . [11] 
 In Norway, the small fishing village of  Røst  above the  Arctic Circle  has a climate bordering on  Csc  and is known as a "climatic anomaly" due to abnormally warm temperatures despite its latitude located above 67°N latitude. [ citation needed ]
