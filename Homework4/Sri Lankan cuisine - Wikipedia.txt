   Traditional Sri Lankan rice and curry 
 Sri Lankan cuisine  is known for its particular combinations of herbs, spices, fish, vegetables, rices, and fruits. The cuisine is highly centered around many varieties of  rice , as well as  coconut  which is a ubiquitous plant throughout the country. Seafood also plays a significant role in the cuisine, be it fresh fish or preserved fish. As a country that was a hub in the historic oceanic silk road, contact with foreign traders brought new food items and cultural influences in addition to the local traditions of the country's ethnic groups, all of which have helped shape Sri Lankan cuisine. Influences from  Indian  (particularly  South Indian ),  Indonesian  and  Dutch cuisines  are most evident with Sri Lankan cuisine sharing close ties to other neighbouring  South  and  Southeast Asian cuisines . [1] 
 Sri Lanka was historically famous for its cinnamon. The  true cinnamon  tree, or  Cinnamomum verum  used to be botanically named  Cinnamomum zeylanicum  to reflect its Sri Lankan origins. This is a widely utilized spice in Sri Lanka, and has a more delicate, sweet taste in comparison to   Cinnamomum cassia  which is more common in some other South East Asian cuisines. Contrasting the local cuisine with those of neighbouring regions, Sri Lankan cuisine is characterized by unique spice blends with heavy use of Sri Lankan cinnamon and black pepper, as well as by the use of ingredients such as  maldive fish ,  goraka  (garcinia cambogia),  pandan leaf ,  lemongrass , and  jaggery  made from the kithul palm syrup. Sri Lanka is also a consumer of many varieties of red rice, some of which are considered heirloom rices in the country. Tea is also an important beverage throughout the country, and Sri Lanka is known for producing some of the world's finest tea.
