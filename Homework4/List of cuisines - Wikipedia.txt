 A  cuisine  is a specific set of  cooking  traditions and practices, often associated with a specific  culture  or region. Each cuisine involves  food preparation  in a particular style, of  food  and  drink  of particular types, to produce individually consumed items or distinct meals. A cuisine is frequently named after the region or place where it originated.  A cuisine is primarily influenced by the ingredients that are available locally or through trade.  Religious  food laws can also exercise a strong influence on such culinary practices.
 
 
 Regional and ethnic cuisines [ edit ] 
 Global cuisine  is a cuisine that is practiced around the world. A cuisine is a characteristic style of cooking practices and traditions, [1]  often associated with a specific region, country [2]  or culture. To become a global cuisine, a local, regional or national cuisine must spread around the world with its food served worldwide.
 Regional cuisine  is based upon national, state or local regions. [3]  Regional cuisines may vary based upon  food  availability and trade, varying  climates ,  cooking  traditions and practices, and  cultural  differences. [4]  One noteworthy definition is based upon  traditional cuisine : "A traditional cuisine is a coherent tradition of food preparation that rises from the daily lives and kitchens of a people over an extended period in a specific region of a country, or a specific country, and which, when localized, has notable distinctions from the cuisine of the country as a whole." [4]
