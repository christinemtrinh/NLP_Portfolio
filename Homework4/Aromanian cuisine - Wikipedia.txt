 Aromanian cuisine  ( Aromanian :  Cujina armãneascã ) is the traditional  cuisine  of the  Aromanians . The Aromanians are a small  Balkan   ethnic group  scattered throughout the region, living in the countries of  Albania ,  Bulgaria ,  Greece ,  North Macedonia ,  Romania  and  Serbia . [1]  Aromanian cuisine has been strongly influenced by  Mediterranean  and  Middle Eastern cuisine . [2] 
 In Greece, the Aromanian village of  Metsovo  ( Aminciu ) stands out for the  cheeses  made there. The most popular cheeses from Metsovo are  Metsovone  and  Metsovela , although other types of cheeses such as  Graviera  are also produced in Metsovo. Much of the cheeses coming from Metsovo are fabricated on the Tositsa Foundation Cheese Factory, operating since 1958. Aside from cheeses, some typical Metsovite dishes include  meats  such as kontosouvli and  sausages , as well as  pies  with  vegetables  and  mushrooms  and  bean soup , all of which can be accompanied with local  wine . [3]  Outside of Metsovo, the Aromanian pie Batzina is popular in the area of  Aspropotamos , and a book has been published on the local cuisine of the village. [4] 
 In Romania, some dishes of the Aromanian community include vegetable pies, especially made of  leek , and fried  peppers . [5]  The Aromanians of Romania also make cheese, and also consume meats such as  poultry  on normal days and  pork  on holidays and special occasions. Various types of  polenta  (or  mămăligă , as known in Romania) also stand out. Aromanian cuisine has some presence in the region of  Dobruja , but virtually none in the rest of Romania. A book has also been published on the Aromanian cuisine of Dobruja. [6]
