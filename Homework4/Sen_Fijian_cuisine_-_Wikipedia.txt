The cuisine of Fiji is renowned for its seafood and various green vegetables, including Ota, a young forest fern that is collected for consumption, and Bele, a plant that resembles spinach and is also known as slippery cabbage.
Most Fijian houses often serve dishes from other cultures, most typically those that immigrants from India and China introduced to Fiji.
Fiji's recent past as a colony of the British Empire has had a significant impact on its cuisine, as the British indentured servitude system brought many Indians to the islands and substantially shaped their present cuisines.
In many homes, breakfast may also include regional dishes like roti and curry, boiled taro and fish soup, and cabin crackers with butter in addition to goods like bread, cereal, milk, tea, and coffee.
