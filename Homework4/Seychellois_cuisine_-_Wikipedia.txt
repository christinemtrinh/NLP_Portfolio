Seychellois cuisine is the cuisine of the Republic of Seychelles, an archipelago country consisting of 115 islands. Fish plays a prominent part in country's cuisine[1] because of its location in the Indian Ocean. The Seychelles's cuisine has been influenced by African, British, French, Spanish, Indian and Chinese cuisines.[2][3]
 The use of spices such as ginger, lemongrass, coriander and tamarind are a significant component of Seychellois cuisine.[3] Fresh fish and fruits are sold by street vendors in various places.[1]
 Staple foods include fish, seafood and shellfish dishes, often accompanied with rice.[1][3] Fish dishes are cooked in several ways, such as steamed, grilled, wrapped in banana leaves, baked, salted[4] and smoked.[1] Curry dishes with rice are also a significant aspect of the country's cuisine.[3][5]
 Additional food staples include shark, breadfruit, mangoes and fish.[2]
 Coconut water and fresh juices are some of the beverages in Seychellois cuisine.[1] Alcoholic drinks include the palm wine calou (or kalou), bakka rum and beers produced in the country such as Seybrew and Eku.[1][2] Wine is obtainable at most Seychelles restaurants.[1]
