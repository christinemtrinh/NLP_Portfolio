 This article includes a list of general  references , but  it lacks sufficient corresponding  inline citations .  Please help to  improve  this article by  introducing  more precise citations.

 Central European cuisine  consists of the culinary  customs , traditions and  cuisines  of the nations of  Central Europe .
 The cuisines within each country in the region is strongly influenced by the local  climate . For example,  German ,  Polish ,  Austrian  and  Czech cuisines  show many similarities, yet differ from the highlander cuisines in their respective countries, while in settlements closer to rivers or lakes, more  fish  and various  seafood  can be found more frequently. More mountainous areas near the  Alps  house dishes that contain  cheese ,  milk  and  butter  among other  dairy products . [1] 
 
 Roman Empire influence [ edit ] 
 During the  Bronze Age  and  Iron Age  the basic foods were  pulses , wild fruits and nuts, and  cereals .  Archaeobotanical  evidence has shown that a large number of new foodstuffs were introduced to Central Europe under Roman rule, becoming incorporated into (rather than replacing) local culinary flavors. Because chickpeas, gourd, black pepper, pistachio, almond, dates, olives, melons and rice were difficult to cultivate locally they remained imported luxuries, out of reach for most. Evidence has been found for dill, celery seeds and other seasonings at  Bibracte  and other excavation sites. [2] [3]
