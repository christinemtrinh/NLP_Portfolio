 Serbian cuisine  ( Serbian :  српска кухиња / srpska kuhinja ) is a  Balkan cuisine  that consists of the culinary methods and traditions of  Serbia . Its roots lie in  Serbian history , including centuries of cultural contact and influence with the Greeks and the  Byzantine Empire , the  Ottomans , and Serbia's  Balkan  neighbours, especially during the existence of  Yugoslavia . Historically, Serbian food develops from pastoral customs that involved the keeping of sheep in mountain highlands, in a climate and regional context that favoured animal husbandry over vegetable farming; Serbian food is therefore traditionally richer in animal products and basic grains - corn, wheat and oats, than fresh vegetable dishes. Following the abandon of widely practiced pastoral lifestyles, Serbian food emerges through the middle ages heavily dependant not on lamb or mutton, but on the keeping of pigs for the annual cull and the production of various cured meats - sausages, bacon and ham products. 
 The  Serbian government  has passed laws banning the production and import of  genetically modified foods , a legislative decision which has been applauded by environmentalists but caused a long-running dispute with the  World Trade Organization , preventing Serbia from being able to join the WTO. [1] [2] [3] 
 
 
 Overview [ edit ] 
   A typical Serbian dinner table at  Christmas . 
   A Serbian rolled pie. 
 National dishes of Serbia include sarma (a mix of ground pork or beef with rice rolled in leaves of cabbage),  gibanica  (an egg and cheese pie made with filo dough),  pljeskavica  (a ground beef or pork patty),  ćevapi  (grilled meat),  paprikaš  (a soup made of paprika),  gulaš  ( soup of meat and vegetables usually seasoned with paprika and other spices) and  Karađorđeva šnicla  (a schnitzel). The national drink is  rakia  (various traditional fruit brandies). 
 With Serbia being located on the crossroads between East and West, its cuisine has gathered elements from different cooking styles across the Middle East and Europe to develop its own hearty gastronomy with an intricate balance of rich meats, vegetables, breads, cheese, fresh pastries, and desserts. It has much in common with the cuisines of neighboring Balkan countries; its flavors are mild, fresh, and natural. Seasonings are usually salt, black pepper, and paprika, while ingredients are known for being fresh and high-quality.  Seasonal food  is an important element of Serbian cuisine, thus many dishes are strongly associated with a specific time of the year.
 The average Serbian eats three meals a day:  breakfast ,  lunch , and  dinner —with lunch being the largest. [4] [5]  However, traditionally, only lunch and dinner existed, with breakfast being introduced in the second half of the 19th century. [5] [6] 
 A number of foods which are usually bought in the West are often made at home in Serbia. These include  rakija ,  slatko ,  jam ,  jelly , and various  pickled foods —notably  turšija ,  ajvar , or  sausages . The reasons for this range from economical to cultural.  Food preparation is a strong part of the Serbian family tradition.
 
 History [ edit ] 
   Easter  breakfast with Easter eggs, cheese, ham, horseradish, pepper salade with garlic, rye bread and cinnamon cakes 
   William , archbishop of Tyre, who visited  Constantinople  in 1179, described the Serbs:
 They are rich in herds and flocks and unusually well supplied with milk, cheese, butter, meat, honey, and wax" . [7] 
 Krušedol  monk of the  Serbian Orthodox Church  Jerotej, wrote the oldest  modern Serbian cookbook in 1855. [8] 
 The first published cookbook in Serbia is The Big Serbian Cookbook ( Велики српски кувар ), written by Katarina Popović-Midzina in 1877. [9] 
 The best known Serbian cookbook is Pata's Cookbook ( Патин кувар ), written by Spasenija Pata Marković in 1907; the book remains in publication even today. [10] 
 An old Serbian legend says that during the time of the 14th-century Serbian Empire, under the rule of Stefan Uroš IV Dušan, meals in the Serbian palace were eaten with golden spoons and forks. Historians say that medieval Serbian cuisine mainly consisted of milk, dairy, produce, and vegetables. Not a lot of bread was eaten, but when it was, the rich ate bread made from wheat and the poor ate bread made from oats and rye. The only meat consumed was wild game, with cattle reserved for agricultural use. [11] 
 
 Meals [ edit ] 
 Breakfast [ edit ] 
 Breakfast in Serbia is an early but hearty meal, rich in calories and carbohydrates, meant to provide one with an abundance of energy to start the day. Bread is frequently served with butter, jam, yogurt, sour cream, or cheese, accompanied by bacon, sausage, salami, eggs, or  kajmak . Serbians often stop by a bakery in the morning for fresh pastries such as  pogačice ,  paštete ,  kifle  (which in Serbian usage may or may not be crescent-shaped, and may be sweet, but may also be sprinkled with salt crystals),  kiflice ,  perece ,  buhtle ,  pletenice ,  štapići ,  zemičke ,  djevreci , mekike, and uštipci. Other common breakfast dishes include  burek ,  kačamak , and cicvara (types of  polenta ) and  popara ,  proja  (cornbread), and čalabrca. Before breakfast most people usually have a cup of  kava , or  espresso , and with the breakfast itself either tea, milk,  milk coffee , or  chocolate milk  is served.

 Appetizers [ edit ] 
 Meze  is an assortment of small dishes and appetizers, though, unlike the Middle Eastern meze, it does not usually include cooked dishes, and is therefore more similar to Italian  antipasto . A Serbian meze typically includes slices of cured meats and sausages, cheeses, olives, fresh vegetables, and  zimnica . Meze is served either to accompany alcoholic drinks or as a starter before a soup on bigger meals.

 Soups [ edit ] 
 Soups are eaten as an entrée at almost every lunch. They are considered to be very important for good health. There are two types of soups in Serbian cuisine: thin soups called  supa , and thicker soups with  roux  or eggs called  čorba . The most common ones are simple pottages made of  beef ,  offal  or  poultry  with added  noodles . Lamb, veal, and  fish soups  are considered delicacies.

 Bread [ edit ] 
 Bread is a staple of Serbian meals, and it is often treated almost ritually. A traditional Serbian welcoming is to offer the guest with  bread and salt ; bread also plays an important role in  religious rituals . Many Serbs believe that it is sinful to throw away bread regardless of how old it is. Although  pasta ,  rice ,  potato , and similar side dishes did enter the everyday cuisine over time, many Serbs still eat bread with meals.
 In most bakeries and shops, white  wheat  bread loaves (typically 0.5 kg) are sold. In modern times, black bread and various  graham bread  variations have regained popularity. In many rural households bread is still baked in cast iron ovens, usually in bigger loaves.

 Dairy products are an important part of the Serbian diet. Fermented products such as  sour milk ,  kajmak ,  yogurt  and  pavlaka  are common breakfast foods, consumed daily. White cheeses, called  sir  are much more common in Serbia than yellow cheeses. There are numerous varieties, some of which have been awarded for their quality, such as the white cheese with walnuts from Babine, which won the 2012 "best autochtonic cheese" award. [12]  Serbian  Pule cheese , made from donkey milk, is the most expensive cheese in the world. [13]  Although less common, several yellow cheese are locally produced.
 
 Meat products [ edit ] 
 Traditional Serbian meat products are simple  ham ,  bacon , dry ribs, and a kind of  pork rinds  called  čvarci . [5]  They are usually produced every autumn or in early winter, during an event called  svinjokolj , where pigs are slaughtered and meat is preserved for the winter.  Cured meats ,  bacon ,  salo ,  čvarci ,  sausages  such as  krvavica , and  kulen  are produced.  Offal  and cheaper cuts of meat are utilized as well, and made into processed products such as  švargla .

 Pies [ edit ] 
 Pies  are very popular in Serbia. They are eaten either for breakfast, dinner, or as a snack. They are most commonly made with thin layers of  phyllo  dough. There are several methods of preparation and numerous types of fillings, both sweet and savory. Serbian pies are usually named after either the preparation method or the filling.
 One variety of  pie  that is not made with  phyllo  is the  štrudla , which, in turn, isn't similar to  strudel , but rather to a  nut roll .

 Drinks [ edit ] 
 Non-alcoholic [ edit ] 
   Serbian coffee 
 Domestic coffee (or Serbian coffee)  is the most commonly consumed non-alcoholic beverage in Serbia. It is mostly prepared at home, rather than bought in coffee shops, and preferably consumed in the company of friends or family.  Slatko ,  ratluk , and  raki  may be served alongside coffee. The majority of the Serbian population starts a day with a cup of coffee in the morning.  Herbal teas  are consumed as a medication, rather than a beverage.  Yogurt  and  kefir  are commonly consumed  dairy  beverages. They frequently accompany savory pastries. A beverage made from  maize , called  boza  or kvas, was once popular, but today is rarely consumed.
 A number of fruit  juice  and  mineral water  brands are produced locally. The  Knjaz Milos  mineral water is considered a national brand.

 Rakija  is a general term for  distilled beverages  made from fruits. There are numerous varieties, which are usually named after the type of fruit they are made from. Comparatively many people brew their own rakija.  Loza , made from grapes, is considered the national drink.
 
 Beer [ edit ]

 Wine [ edit ]

 There are nearly 110,000 hectares of vineyards in Serbia, producing about 645,000 tons of grapes annually, with South Serbia producing the most. Because of that, Serbia is internationally recognized as a great wine producer.
