   Traditional Kurdish food 
   Paklawa (Baklawa) 
 Kurdish cuisine  ( Kurdish :  خواردنی کوردی  or  Xwarina Kurdî ) consists of a wide variety of foods prepared by the  Kurdish people . There are cultural similarities of Kurds and their immediate neighbours in  Iran ,  Iraq ,  Turkey ,  Syria , and  Armenia . Kurdish food is typical of western Asian cuisine.
 
 
 Culinary customs [ edit ] 
 The Kurdish diet includes a wide variety of fruits and vegetables. Lamb and  chicken  are the primary meats. Breakfast is typically  flat bread ,  cheese ,  honey , sheep or cow  yogurt , and a glass of  black tea . For lunch,  lamb  and vegetables are simmered in a  tomato sauce  to make a stew usually served with  rice  and savory dishes are usually served with rice or flat bread ( Naan ). Kurdistan has a climate and soil suited to  grapes ,  pomegranates ,  figs , and  walnuts . Kurdish honey has a clear light taste and is often sold with the  honeycomb . Kurdistan also produces dairy products from  sheep  and  cow milk . Kurds make many types of  kofta  and  kubba ,  dumplings  filled with meat.
 Kurdish cuisine makes abundant use of fresh herbs and spices. [1]

 Sweetened black tea is a very common drink, along with bitter strong coffee. Another favourite Kurdish drink is "mastow" ( Sorani ) or "Ava Mast", which is yogurt and salt mixed with water. The fermented version of this is called Do ( Doogh ). [2]  Both beverages are often served with the addition of dill, mint, pennyroyal or seeds from the Pistacia kurdica tree.
 Staples of Kurdish cuisine are  berbesel ,  biryani ,  dokliw ,  kellane ,  kullerenaske ,  kutilk ,  parêv   tobouli ,  kuki  ( meat  or vegetable pies),  birinç  ( white rice  alone or with meat or vegetables and herbs), and a variety of salads, pastries, and drinks specific to different parts of Kurdistan. Other popular dishes are  makluba ,  kofta ,  shifta ,  shilah /maraga, spinach with eggs, wheat & lentil soup, beet & meat soup, sweet turnip, cardamon cookies,  burgul pilaf ,  mehîr ,  hûr û rûvî , pel ( yaprakh ),  chichma  this dish is common in  Erbil  (Hewlêr),  tefti ,  niskene  and  nane niskan . [3] 
 Sawarr , a traditional dish among Kurdish farmers, is made of wheat grain that is boiled, sun dried and pounded in a mortar ( curn ) to get rid of the husk. The wheat is then crushed in a mill ( destarr ). The resulting grain food can be boiled and served. [4] 
 Tapsi  is a dish of  aubergines ,  green peppers ,  courgettes  and potatoes in a slightly spicy tomato sauce.  Tashreeb  consists of layers of naan in a sauce of green pepper, tomato, onions and chillies. [5] 
A typical Kurdish breakfast consists of cheese, butter, olives, eggs, tomatoes, cucumbers, green peppers, reçel (jam/marmalade; a preserve of whole fruits) and honey usually consumed on top of  kaymak . Sausage, baked goods and even soups can be taken as a morning meal in Kurdistan. Perhaps more so than traditional breads such as pide, a crusty white loaf is widely consumed. A common Kurdish speciality for breakfast is called  menemen , which is prepared with roasted tomatoes, peppers, olive oil and eggs. Invariably, black tea is served at breakfast.
 
 Dishes and foods [ edit ] 
 Dairy products [ edit ] 
 In  Kurdistan ,  yoghurt  is called  mast , [6]  and is considered the most popular fermented dairy product. It is produced from cow milk or a mixture of sheep and goat milk using the traditional method. Dairy products comprise a large portion of traditional Kurdish food.
 Keşk known as  Kashk  is a fermented and strained sour yogurt that can be consumed on its own as a cheese, or used as an ingredient in soups.
 
 Cheeses [ edit ] 
 The  Kurds  produce many varieties of  cheese , mostly from  sheep 's milk. Kurdish cheese has been traditionally prepared from raw milk and it is ripened in goat's skin bags.
