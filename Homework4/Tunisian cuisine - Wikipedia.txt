   Location of Tunisia 
 Tunisian cuisine , the  cuisine  of  Tunisia , consists of the cooking traditions, ingredients, recipes and techniques developed in Tunisia since  antiquity. It is mainly a blend of  Mediterranean  and native  Punics - Berber cuisine . 
Historically, Tunisian cuisine  influenced many cultures and nations like  Italians ,  Andalusians ,  French  and  Arabs .
 Like many countries in the Mediterranean basin, the Tunisian cuisine is heavily based on  olive oil , spices,  tomatoes , seafood and meat. Yet, it has a distinctive spiciness that differs it from surrounding cuisines.
 
 
 Origins [ edit ] 
 Tunisian cuisine developed from  Berbers , ancient Carthage, Rome, the Islamic conquest of the  Maghreb , and the  Ottoman Empire . The cuisine has been strongly influenced by French and Italian (especially Sicilian) cooking. [1] 
 During its era of  French colonial rule  Tunisia marketed its difference to  metropolitan France  meaning it played on French perceptions of "difference" ( Orientalism ) to sell the produce of the colonies to France. The majority of restaurants that catered to international visitors did not serve authentic colonial cuisine. Exoticness and difference were emphasized instead in  souks  and eateries. The European settlers who traveled to and from France shared their food experiences with the metropolitan French, but authentic Tunisian cuisine did not become integrated into the popular  cuisine coloniale  category of  French cuisine . [2] 
 
 Ingredients [ edit ] 
   The  North African  dish  asida  is a lump of cooked wheat dough, sometimes with added butter or honey 
   Merguez  is a red, spicy  mutton  or  beef -based fresh sausage 
   Egg  shakshouka  made in Tunisia 
 Unlike other North African cuisines, Tunisian food is quite spicy. A popular condiment and ingredient which is used extensively in Tunisian cooking,  harissa , is a mix of ground  chili peppers , garlic, and  caraway [3]  or spices commonly sold together as a paste. It is usually the most important ingredient in different sauces and gravies. Westernised harissa mostly contains red chilies to replace  black cumin , which is different from standard cumin. Other common spices include  cumin  or cumin seeds,  garlic ,  caraway  seeds,  coriander  seeds and  paprika . A recipe for the sauce includes red chili peppers and garlic, flavored with coriander, cumin,  olive oil  and often  tomatoes . [ citation needed ] 
 Like  harissa  or chili peppers, tomato paste is also an ingredient integral to the cuisine of Tunisia.  Tuna ,  eggs ,  olives  and various varieties of  pasta ,  cereals , herbs and spices are also ingredients which are prominently used in Tunisian cooking. [4] 
 Potatoes were introduced by European settlers in the early 20th century and have become a common ingredient in traditional salads, sauces and couscous. By 1990 one of the most common homemade foods with potatoes was  French fries . [5] 
 Tunisian culinary ingredients include the following typical elements: [6] 
 
 Condiments  and  flavorings :  harissa ,  rose water ,  orange blossom water , jasmine water and  geranium water . 
 Eggs . 
 Farm animals :  lamb ,  veal ,  beef ,  camel  and  chicken . 
 Fish  and  seafood :  tuna ,  squid  ( calamari ),  octopus ,  anchovies ,  eel ,  sardines ,  mackerel ,  red snapper ,  sea bream ,  sea snails  and  sea bass . 
 Fruits :  lemon ,  oranges ,  figs ,  dates ,  olives ,  apricots ,  pomegranates  and  quince . 
 Herbs :  parsley ,  coriander ,  mint ,  basil ,  rosemary ,  oregano ,  bay leaves  and  thyme . 
 Nuts :  hazelnuts ,  almonds ,  chestnuts ,  pine nuts  and  peanuts . 
 Spices :  garlic ,  anise ,  saffron ,  cinnamon ,  caraway ,  coriander ,  cumin ,  fennel ,  fenugreek ,  ginger ,  white pepper ,  black pepper ,  red pepper  and  cloves . 
 Vegetables :  onions ,  bell peppers ,  carrots ,  chickpeas ,  tomatoes ,  capers ,  celery ,  turnips ,  potatoes ,  chili peppers  ( Baklouti peppers ),  cucumbers  and  eggplants . 
 Other popular ingredients:  honey . 
 Tunisians also produce grapes, wheat, barley and orchard fruits. Once fermented they become wines, as in Chateau Mornag which is a staple  Tunisian wine , beers (Celtia, Berber or the Stella brand—now owned by Heineken of the Netherlands), brandy ( Boukha — fig  liqueur, Thibarine—herbal date liqueur, or other liqueurs made from  pomegranates , dates,  lotos  (jujube),  carobs  or  prickly pears ) and apple ciders. Scented waters with dark rose or blossom petals, similar to  aguas frescas  with flowers, have been called "scents from heaven".
 Tabil , pronounced "tebel," is a word in  Tunisian Arabic  meaning "seasoning" (similar to  adobo  in Spanish) and now refers to a particular Tunisian spice mix, although earlier it only meant ground coriander.  Paula Wolfert  makes the plausible claim that  tabil  is one of the spice mixes brought to Tunisia by Muslims coming from  Andalusia  in 1492 after the fall of  Granada . Today,  tabil , closely associated with the cooking of Tunisia, features garlic, cayenne pepper, caraway seeds and coriander pounded in a mortar, then dried in the sun. It is often used in cooking beef, veal and game. Organs are traditionally staples of Tunisian cooking, such as tripe, lamb brains, beef liver and fish heads.
 Due to the long coastline and numerous fishing ports, seafood has a prominent place in Tunisian cuisine. Fish can also be grilled, baked, fried, or stuffed and seasoned with  cumin  ( kamoun ).  Squid ,  cuttlefish  and  octopus  are served in hot crispy batter with slices of lemon, in a cooked salad, or stuffed and served with couscous.
 Snails  have been eaten in Tunisia since prehistoric times, as excavated mounds of shells, mixed with stone tools and artifacts from the  Caspian civilization  in the region of  Gafsa  have proven. [7]  Today, snails are still enjoyed in several regions, such as Hammamet, the central coast (Sahel) and Kairouan, but shunned in others. [8] 
 
 Regional cuisines [ edit ] 
 Tunisia has different regional aspects. Tunisian cuisine varies from north to south, from the coast to the  Atlas Mountains , from urban areas to the countryside, and along religious affiliations. 
 For instance, the original inhabitants of Tunis (the Beldiya), do not use  harissa  much; they prefer milder food, and have also developed their own breads and desserts.
 Closer to the Atlas mountain range, game is favoured. A diet may be composed of  quail , pigeons,  squabs ,  partridge , rabbits and hare. In the Cap Bon, people enjoy tuna, anchovies, sardines, sea bass and mackerels. On the island of  Djerba , where there is a dense  Jewish  presence,  kosher  food is consumed.
 Despite the strong presence of fast food and restaurants in  Sfax , people from the city enjoy their traditional dishes more than anything else. Sfaxians tend to add their own touch to the Tunisian cuisine. They have staple regional dishes such as  marka  which is a fish soup to which Sfaxians usually add vermicelli or couscous. The soup can also be eaten with barley bread or croutons.  Charmoula  is a dish made of baked raisins, onions and spices, traditionally eaten with salted fish on the First day of  Eid al-Fitr . Sfax is also famed for its pastries. There are two kinds of Sfaxian pastries: daily pastry (locally called  hlou Arbi ) like  makrouth ,  doria , and  ghraiba , and high-range pastry for weddings and special ceremonies (like  baklawa ,  mlabbes  and  ka'ak warka' ). [9] 
 The region of  Gabes  is famous for using  hrous  seasonning instead of  harissa  (hrous Gabsi is a paste whose main ingredients are 50% salt pickled onions, 50% dried red chili, unlike harissa which doesn't contain onions). [4] 
 In  Djerba , kosher cuisine is available as well as a myriad of restaurants [10]  offering a wide range of regional dishes like  rouz djerbi  and mainly seafood-based meals.
 
 Main dishes [ edit ] 
   Couscous  with meat Osban 
 Couscous [ edit ] 
 Couscous , called  kosksi , is the national dish of Tunisia, and can be prepared in many ways. It is cooked in a special kind of double boiler called a  kiska:s  in Arabic or  couscoussière  in French. The couscous used is typically fine-grained. Called kosksi in the Tunisian dialect, it is a tiny granule made from steamed and dried durum wheat. It is the most popular national dish. Couscous is a dish for all events. It is frequently served in an enormous traditional bowl with bits of meat and vegetables. It is served mostly on festive occasions and large gatherings, from weddings to funerals.
 Meats, vegetables and spices are cooked in the lower pot. Cooking steam rises through vents into the container above. It is layered with whole herbs such as bay leaves and covered with a fine-grain couscous. The couscous pasta is therefore cooked with aromatic steam. During the cooking process, the couscous needs to be regularly stirred with a fork to prevent lumping, much as  risotto  is cooked. 
 The word  couscous  (alternately  cuscus  or  kuskus ) was first noted in early 17th century French, from Arabic kuskus, from kaskasa 'to pound', and is probably of  Berber  origin. [11] [12] [13]  The exact formation of the word presents some obscurities. [11]  The Berber root *KS means "well formed, well rolled, rounded". [11] [12]  Numerous names and pronunciations for couscous exist around the world. [14] : 919  
 Couscous has been recognized on UNESCO's list of Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2018. This new designation by UNESCO is due to the worth of couscous and the tradition, practices, and ability that encompass it.
 
 Meats [ edit ] 
 Preferred meats include lamb ( kosksi bil ghalmi ) or chicken ( kosksi bil djaj ), but regional substitutes include red snapper, grouper ( kousksi bil mannani ), sea bass ( kosksi bil warqua ), hare ( kosksi bil arnab ) or quail ( kosksi bil hjall ).
 Pork consumption is forbidden to Muslims in Tunisia, in accordance with  Islamic dietary laws .
 
 Tajine [ edit ] 
 Tunisian  tajines  or  tajine  refers to a kind of  quiche , without a crust, made with beaten eggs, grated cheese, meat and various vegetable fillings, and baked like a large cake. The Tunisian  tagine  is very different from the Algerian or Moroccan dish but similar to the Italian  frittata  or the  eggah .
 
 Seafood [ edit ] 
 A popular seafood specialty is  poisson complet  or the whole fish. The entire fish, excluding internal organs, is prepared and fire-grilled, but it can also be fried, grilled or sautéed. It is accompanied with potato chips and either mild or spicy  tastira , made by frying green peppers, tomatoes, onion and a little garlic, all of which is finely chopped and served with an egg poached or sunny side up. Finely chopped fresh parsley is sprinkled on top; a drizzle of lemon juice and a pinch of sea salt complete the recipe.
 
 Sauces [ edit ] 
 Tunisian sauces, which are closer to spicy broths, are an integral part of dishes. Otherwise olive oils are often used as sauces.
 Harissa  or  hrissa  is often said to be a Tunisian sauce, but it is better described as an ingredient of Tunisian cooking or a seasoning.  Harissa  is made of red chili, garlic, salt, cumin, coriander, olive oil, and sometimes also caraway or mint.
 Kerkennaise  and  mloukhia  are other frequently used sauces.  Kerkennaise  is made of capers, olive oil, tomato, scallions, coriander, caraway, cumin, parsley, garlic, white vinegar and paprika.  Mloukhia  is a dark green sauce served with shredded lamb or beef.
