 Cuisine of Western Sahara 
   Location of  Western Sahara 
   Saharawi cuisine 
   Saharawi bread 
 Western Saharan cuisine  comprises the  cuisine  of  Western Sahara , a  disputed territory  in the  Maghreb  region of  North Africa , bordered by  Morocco  to the north,  Algeria  to the extreme northeast,  Mauritania  to the east and south, and the  Atlantic Ocean  to the west. The Western Saharan cuisine has several influences, as the population of that area ( Sahrawi ), in their most part are of  Arabic  and  Berber  origin. The Saharawi cuisine is also influenced by  Spanish cuisine  owing to Spanish colonisation.
 Food is primarily imported into Western Sahara, as minimal rainfall in the territory inhibits agricultural production. [1]  Indigenous sources of food include those derived from  fishing  and  nomadic pastoralism . [1]  The labor and business in these indigenous provisions of foods are also a primary contributor of  income  for the territory's population, and are among the primary contributors to the  economy of Western Sahara . [1] 
 A major  staple food  is the  couscous  that often accompanies one way or another all the food dishes. The influences of southern cuisine makes  peanuts  an accompaniment of some dishes.
 For meat, the Sahrawis favour  camel  and  goat ;  pork  is not eaten, since it is not  halal ;  lamb  is also prominent. Some tribes are famous for growing wheat, barley and cereals in general.
 Some  fruits  and  vegetables  are grown in  oases  that are scattered within the territory. [ citation needed ] 
 
 
 Common foods and dishes [ edit ]

 Beverages [ edit ] 
   Saharawi tea 
 Tea  is more than just a drink for the Saharawi people. It is a way to meet with friends and family to share moments of conversation and friendship. It usually follows a ritual, in which are taken three vessels. In this regard, there is a popular comment: "The first glass of tea is bitter like life, the second cup sweet like love and the third soft as death." [2]
