   A woman cooking in Sudan 
 Sudanese cuisine  is greatly affected by the historical cross-cultural influences of Arab, Nubian, Egyptian, Turkish, and Levantine cuisine in  Sudan . Many Sudanese foods have been around for thousands of years. The most common meats eaten are lamb and chicken, in accordance with the Muslim  halal  laws. Most meals are communal and often shared with family, neighbors, and guests, as part of Sudanese hospitality.
 Breads such as  aisha  (or  aish baladi ) and  kisra  (or  kasra )—a thin pancake-like bread similar to a  crêpe —are eaten with savory stews ( mullah ), cheese ( jibna ),  fava beans , and  falafel  ( tamiya ). There is also  gorrassa  (or  gurasa ), a fermented bread similar to Ethiopian  injera , but thinner and smaller.
 
 
 Influences [ edit ] 
 Egyptian cuisine  has greatly influenced Sudanese cuisine. Both share dishes such as  falafel  ( tamiya ), which is made with chickpeas in Sudan instead of fava beans as in Egypt;  ful medames , the national dish of both Sudan and Egypt;  molokhia , a thick soup made from boiled leaves;  kamounia , a meat liver stew eaten in Sudan, Egypt and Tunisia; and desserts such as  umm ali  and  basbousa .  Jibna bayda , a soft white cheese, is also eaten. [1] 
 Turkish cuisine has also influenced Sudanese cuisine, giving it a distinct flavor. Turkish foods found in Sudanese cuisine include  kebabs ,  kofta , and  shawarma , as well as sweets such as  baklava . Levantine and Egyptian sweets also entered Sudanese cuisine and are known as  oriental  (or  Levantine )  sweets .
 
 Appetizers [ edit ] 
 Meals include  elmaraara  and  umfitit , which are dishes made from sheep's  offal  (including the lungs, liver, and stomach), onions, peanut butter, and salt. They are eaten raw. [2]  A peanut salad called  salatat dakaw  is also eaten. [3] 
 
 Soups and stews [ edit ] 
 A popular Sudanese  mullah  (savory stew) is  mullah ahmar , [4]  a red mincemeat sauce that is eaten with  asida , a dish consisting of boiled  wheat flour  molded into a ball.  Asida  is eaten across  North Africa . Other  mullahs  will sometimes use  waika , special sauce made from crushed  okra  and  niaimiya , [5]  a spice mix that gives some  mullahs  a sticky yet flavorful texture. Dried  waika  is sometimes used as a seasoning in the  mullah . Most Sudanese  mullahs  will have either meat or other  vegetables  or  legumes . Sometimes seasoned meats is used such as in  Mullah sharmout —made of dried meats, onions and dried okra (crushed  waika )—is added to most types of  mullah .
 Several stews, including  waika ,  bussaara , and  sabaroag , use  ni'aimiya  (a Sudanese spice mix) and dried  okra .  Miris  is a stew made from sheep's fat, onions, and dried okra.  Abiyad  is made from dried meat, while  kajaik  is made from dried fish. [2]  In  Equatoria  (now in  South Sudan ), soups include  kawari , made from cattle or sheep  hooves  with vegetables, and  elmussalammiya , made from  liver , flour,  dates , and spices. [2] 
 
 Beverages [ edit ] 
   Sudanese  jabana  coffee pot 
 The most popular drink is tap or bottled water, traditionally offered free of charge for anyone in large claypots in the streets. Strong coffee, sometimes served in Sudanese coffee pots called  jabana , and black tea, often with milk, are also popular. These are sold in the streets by "tea ladies". Especially on hot days, traditional cold  hibiscus tea , called  karkadeh , is made in homes. [2] 
 
 Alcoholic beverages [ edit ] 
 Historically, Sudan was one of the few predominantly Muslim countries that allowed traditional and Western alcoholic drinks. Men drank  millet wine ,  sharbot  (an alcoholic drink from fermented dates), and  araqi . In the 20th century, some Sudanese were influenced by Europeans and began drinking whiskey and beer.
 In September 1983, former Sudanese President  Gaafar Nimeiry  enacted  Sharia , marking the occasion by dumping alcohol into the  Nile river . [6] [7]  Since then, the purveying, consumption, and purchasing of alcohol has been banned in Sudan. Being lashed 40 times is the penalty for breaking the prohibition on alcohol. [7]  Nevertheless,  araqi , an alcoholic gin made from  dates , continued to be illegally brewed in defiance of Sharia. [7]  In 2019, the Transitional Government passed a new law, allowing alcoholic beverages for non-Muslims.
