 The  cuisine of  Rwanda  is based on local  staple foods  produced by the traditional  subsistence-level agriculture  and has historically varied across different areas. [1] 
 
 
 Background [ edit ] 
 Rwandan staples include  bananas ,  plantains ,  pulses ,  sweet potatoes , beans, and  cassava  (manioc). Historically this is particularly true of the  Twa  and the  Hutus  who hunted and farmed. Their diet was high in vegetables and lacking in animal protein due to the small amount of animal products consumed. The  Tutsis  were traditionally  pastoralists  and consumed a higher amount of milk and dairy products. [1] 
 Many Rwandans eat a lot of meat nowadays. [1]  For those that live near lakes and have access to fish,  tilapia  is popular. [1]  The  potato , thought to have been introduced to Rwanda by  German  and  Belgian colonists , is now very popular and is cultivated in the towns of  Gitarama  and  Butare . [2] 
 
 National dishes [ edit ] 
   A plate of  ugali  and  cabbage 
 Various dishes have evolved from the range of basic foods consumed.  Ugali  (or  bugali ), eaten throughout sub-Saharan Africa, is a paste made from maize and water to form a  porridge -like consistency. [3]   Isombe  is made from mashed cassava leaves and served with meat or fish. [2] 
 Matoke  is a dish made from baked or steamed bananas. [3]   Ibihaza  is made from pumpkins cut into pieces, mixed with beans and boiled without peeling them. The groundnut paste  ikinyiga  and millet flour paste  umutsima w’uburo  are made from boiling water and flour, mixed to a porridge-like consistency. [4]  In the restaurants in the capital city of  Kigali , locals and  expatriates  eat a variety of international cuisine, including  Indian ,  Chinese ,  Italian , and  African . [5]  In other cities and towns, the cuisine is simpler, often consisting of chicken, fish, goat or steak served with rice or  French fries . [5] 
 
 Beverages [ edit ] 
 Milk is a common drink among Rwandans. [6]  Other popular drinks in Rwanda include fruit juice, wine, beer and  soda  (Fanta) for those who do not drink alcohol. [7]  Commercial beers drunk in Rwanda include  Primus ,  Mützig  and  Amstel . [3]  In rural areas,  urwagwa  is a beer made from the fermented juice of bananas that has been mixed with roasted  sorghum  flour. [8] 
 Beers feature in traditional rituals and ceremonies and are generally consumed only by men. [2]   Ikigage  is an alcoholic beverage made from dry sorghum that is thought to have medicinal powers. [9]   Ubuki  is made from fermented  honey  and has an alcohol content of about 12 percent. [10]
