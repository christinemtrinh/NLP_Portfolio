 Culinary traditions of Brunei 
 
 
   Ambuyat , the  national dish  of Brunei. 
 Bruneian cuisine  concerns the cuisine of  Brunei . It is similar to, and heavily influenced by the cuisine of neighbouring  Malaysia ,  Singapore , [1]  and  Indonesia , with additional influences from India, China, Thailand, and Japan.  As is common in the region, fish and rice are staple foods, though beef is expensive and thus less common.  Due to the predominance of the Islamic religion, the food is  halal  and pork is avoided. Alcohol is banned in Brunei. [1]  In rural areas, game animals such as wild birds,  sambar deer , and  barking deer  are hunted.
 
 
 Foods and dishes [ edit ] 
 Dishes from Brunei are often  spicy , and are commonly eaten with either  rice  or  noodles . Beef rendang, nasi lemak and pajeri nanas are popular foods in Brunei. [2]  Among the few dishes peculiar to Brunei is  ambuyat , a sticky ball of flavourless  sago  starch, which is wrapped around a bamboo fork and dipped into a spicy and sour gravy.  Nasi katok , which literally means 'knock rice', consists of plain rice, fried chicken and sambal, a spicy relish made from ground chili peppers and a variety of secondary ingredients including shrimp paste, garlic, ginger, shallot, scallion, palm sugar, lime juice, vinegar and anchovies.  Nasi katok  is traditionally served wrapped in brown paper.
 
 Beverages [ edit ] 
   Coconut milk 
 Common drinks include  coconut milk ,  fruit juice ,  tea ,  milk tea  and  coffee .
