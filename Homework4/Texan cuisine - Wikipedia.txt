 Texan cuisine  is the food associated with the  Southern   U.S. state  of  Texas , including its native  Southwestern   cuisine  influenced  Tex-Mex  foods. Texas is a large state, and its cuisine has been influenced by a wide range of cultures, including Southern, German, Czech, British, African American, Creole/Cajun, Mexican, New Mexican, Native American, Asian, and Italian.
 The cuisine of neighboring states also influences Texan cuisine, such as  New Mexican cuisine  and  Louisiana Creole cuisine , as such  New Mexico chile ,  Cayenne peppers , and  Tabasco sauce  are often used in Texan cooking. [2] [3] 
 
 
 Agriculture [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Agriculture in Texas 
 In the 1880s, citrus growers in Texas and Florida discovered pink-fleshed seedless  grapefruit  mutations like the Ruby. Early varieties like the Duncan had many seeds and pale flesh. [4] 
 
 Specialties [ edit ] 
 Barbecue [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Barbecue in Texas 
 Texas barbecue was influenced by the cooking technique  barbacoa , a method of slow cooking meat that has been wrapped in leaves in a covered  pit .
 In the 19th century,  cowboys  developed techniques to cook the tough beef from range  cattle  over coals and colonial style open pit barbecue was brought to the state when blacks arrived from the southeast, but later developed into closed pit Western-style barbecue which uses indirect heat instead of coals and imparts a smokier flavor.
 Barbecue in Texas is most commonly served with white bread, spicy sauces, pickles, sliced onion, and  jalapeños ; sides include  pinto beans ,  potato  or rice salad, and cabbage slaw. Common desserts served with barbecue are  fruit cobbler ,  banana pudding , and  pecan pie .
 
 Steak and beef [ edit ] 
 Texas is among a handful of states that developed an early preference for beef barbecue, alongside other states in the neighboring  cuisine of the Southwestern United States  and the  cuisine of the Western United States . [4]   Beef brisket  (slowly cooked in smoke in a wood-fired "pit") is the most common barbecue. [ citation needed ] 
 The influence of  steak  on Texas barbecue is so great that it is often highlighted in popular culture, for example the animated sitcom  King of the Hill . Restaurants that serve Texan cuisine, such as  The Big Texan Steak Ranch , and even national brands like  Texas Roadhouse , often specialize in steak in particular.
 It is illegal to defame the cattle and ranching industries, of either Texas or the  Southwestern United States , within the state of Texas. [5] 
 
 Pork [ edit ] 
 Near the end of the 19th century, immigrants from Germany and Eastern Europe introduced their own distinctive culinary traditions, including  sausage  making, marked by bold and sometimes piquant spicing and coarser texture, which became part of Texan barbecue culture and smoked  sausage  remains a popular dish at Western-style barbecues. [4]  Early American traditional whole-hog barbecues and later rib barbecues were prepared with pork.
 
 Dessert and pastry [ edit ] 
   Fried  sopapillas  pastries 
 Czech immigrants brought a tradition of pastry-making including fruit-filled  kolaches   and sausage-filled  klobasniky , pastries. The  Texas Legislature  has declared  West, Texas  is the "Home of the Official Kolache of the Texas Legislature," while  Caldwell, Texas  is "Kolache Capital of Texas." [6]   Strudel  was brought to Texas by European immigrants. [7] 
 Sopapillas  are a simple fried pastry dough sweetened with sugar and cinnamon. [8]  The dish has roots in a lard-fried pastry made by the  Tigua Pueblo  and  Franciscan friars  from  New Mexico  in  Ysleta, El Paso . This early form of the pastry dates to at least 1682, as the style originates in  New Mexican cuisine , making it one of the earliest pastries known found in Texan cuisine. [7] 
 
   Texan  peanut butter pie 
 Pecan pie  is the official state pie of Texas.  The crust for another local specialty,  peanut butter pie , is made with crushed vanilla wafers and peanuts. The filling is a sweetened peanut butter pudding made with milk, sugar, peanut butter,  corn starch  and egg yolks. [9] 
 Though the origin of the term  Texas sheet cake  is unknown, with some speculating it's a reference to the cake's large size or decadence, and others who believe it's because the cake includes Texas-style ingredients like buttermilk and  pecans , the cake has become a popular dessert throughout the United States since the original recipe was  published by  The Dallas Morning News  in 1957. [10] 
 Peach cobbler  is the official cobbler. [11] 
 
 Hamburger [ edit ] 
 An early claim to the invention of the  hamburger  was  Fletcher Davis  of  Athens, Texas , who claimed to have served it at his restaurant at a time when there were more cows than people in Texas. According to oral histories, in the 1880s, he opened a lunch counter in Athens and served a "burger" of fried ground beef patties with mustard and Bermuda onion between two slices of bread; with a pickle on the side. [12] 
 The claim is that in 1904, Davis and his wife Ciddy ran a sandwich stand at the St. Louis World's Fair. Historian Frank X. Tolbert noted that Athens resident  Clint Murchison  said his grandfather dated the hamburger to the 1880s with "Old Dave" a.k.a. Fletcher Davis.
 A photo of "Old Dave's Hamburger Stand" from the 1904 connection was sent to Tolbert as evidence of the claim. [13]  Also the  New York Tribune  namelessly attributed the innovation of the hamburger to the stand on the pike.
 
 Southern [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Cuisine of the American South 
 European settlers and  African American slaves  brought the culinary traditions of the   Deep South  with them including  biscuits ,  red-eye gravy ,  pan-fried chicken ,  black-eyed peas , [7]   mashed potatoes ,  cornbread  or corn pone,  sweet tea , and desserts like  peach cobbler  and  pecan pie .
 Even after  emancipation , many former slaves who had been cooks and domestic servants were not able to afford the highest quality meats and are recognized for the skilled preparation of simple ingredients like greens and beans flavored with  salt pork ,  hog jowl , peppers and spices.
 These staple dishes were served alongside  game meats , fried chicken and  fried catfish . [7]  French immigrants from Louisiana introduced influences from  Cajun  and  Louisiana Creole cuisine . [7] 
 Some claim the  corn dog  was invented by vendors at the  Texas State Fair . [14] 
 Confederate cush  is a dish associated with Confederate troops, the preparation of which was described by one Texas native in 1863 as follows: "chop up a small quantity of fat bacon into a frying pan, get the grease all out of it, put in a quart of water, when it boils crumble in cold corn bread and stir until dry". [4] 
 Fried  okra  is a quintessential side dish throughout the American South, including Texas. [15] 
 
 Hybrid cuisines [ edit ] 
   Chicken fried steak  with cream gravy served at Moonshine Grill [16]  in  Austin, Texas 
 Dating back to the era of   French  and  Spanish  colonial rule in Texas, relations between ethnic groups were tense throughout history, but despite these animosities they have enjoyed food from varied cuisines and incorporated borrowed ingredients into their own, contributing to Texas's varied and rich food culture. [17] 
 Tex-Mex  is the best known hybrid cuisine from Texas but there are many others with contributions from around thirty ethnic groups including Czech, Korean, and Indian. Korean donut shops sell  jalapeño   kolaches , Indians make  fajitas  with  chutney , and Czech-Tex style  hot dogs  are topped with both  sauerkraut  and  chili con carne . Other fusion dishes like  bulgogi  and  banh mi  burgers can be found as well. [17] 
 The origin of  chicken fried steak  is unknown. The town of  Lamesa, Texas  is claimed as the source of the dish.  Governor Rick Perry  declared it the "birthplace of the chicken fried steak" in 2011. [18]  Lamesa hosts the Chicken Fried Steak Festival each April. [19]  Another view is that the dish developed in the cattle country of Texas and the  Midwest  and still another holding that it's a variation of German  schnitzel . [4] 
 
 Tex-Mex [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Tex-Mex cuisine 
 Tex-Mex refers to a style of cooking that combines traditional Northeastern Mexican cuisine that makes heavy use of beef and extremely hot, tiny  chiltepin  pepper . Combination plates featuring  tacos ,  enchiladas  and  tostadas  served alongside rice and beans are not found in traditional Mexican cuisine.
 This custom developed only when Mexican-American cooks adapted offerings for customers who preferred a full plate, rather than the traditional style of eating small, separate dishes. [4] 
 Commercial manufacture of chili powders began in Texas in the 1890s. [4]  Today, chili is the official state dish. [11]  Texas is known for its own variation of  chili con carne .
 Texas chili is typically made with hot peppers and beef (or sometimes game meats like  venison ) and is sometimes served with  pinto beans , either as a side or in the chili itself.
 The dish can be topped with an assortment of garnishes including fresh or pickled  jalapeños , raw onions or crumbled  soda crackers . Thick chili gravy is served over  tamales  and  enchiladas . [4] 
 Frank X. Tolbert 's 1953 recipe included beef-kidney  suet ,  ancho chiles  and lean beef for stewing such as chuck seasoned with  oregano ,  garlic ,  cumin  and  cayenne pepper . [20] 
 Breakfast items include scrambled egg in flour tortilla tacos as  migas  and  huevos con chorizo ,  huevos rancheros , and  empanadas  of various meats.
 King Ranch casserole  is made with chicken,  cream of mushroom  and  chicken soups , cheese and  tortilla chips . [4] 
 Entrees are commonly accompanied by pan fried potato and  refried beans . 
Ingredients commonly used in Tex-Mex cuisine include goat, chicken, pork, beef, venison, eggs, cheese, milk, beans,  masa harina , peppers, chocolate, and various spices. [7] 
 Puffy tacos made with deep-fried handmade corn tortillas and served with beef  picadillo  are a  San Antonio  specialty. [21] 
 Pan de campo  is the official state bread. [11]  Also called "cowboy bread", the simple recipe was traditionally baked in a  Dutch oven . [22] 
 Desserts include  flan ,  tres leches  cake ,  sopapillas  and  pralines .
 
   Traditional beef tripe stew called  menudo 
 In the ranch lands of the 1930s, after cattle were butchered, the hide, the head, the entrails, and meat trimmings such as skirt were given to the Mexican cowboys called  vaqueros  as part of their pay. [ citation needed ] 
 Hearty dishes like  barbacoa de cabeza  (barbecued head),  menudo  (tripe stew), and  fajitas  or  arracheras  (grilled  skirt steak ) have their roots in this practice. [ citation needed ]  Considering the limited number of skirts per carcass and that the meat wasn't available commercially, the  fajita  tradition remained regional and relatively obscure for many years, probably only familiar to vaqueros, butchers, and their families. [23]  Modern "fajitas" were introduced at a county fair in  Kyle, Texas  in 1969 by Sonny Falcon, who later opened an  Austin  restaurant offering fajitas as a main fare. [24] [25] 
 Other dishes associated with Tex-Mex cooking include  guacamole ,  chile con queso ,  tostadas  with red salsa,  tortilla soup ,  nachos ,  tacos ,  quesadillas ,  chimichangas ,  burritos ,  and  carne guisada [26] . 
 
 Notable restaurants [ edit ] 
 The now defunct  Kirby's Pig Stand  was the first drive in restaurant in the United States. Founder Jessie G. Kirby reportedly pitched it to potential investors in Dallas as a type of roadside dining establishment where people could order and eat without leaving their vehicles. The restaurant served "pig sandwich" made with roast pork, pickle relish and barbecue sauce. [4] 
 
 Food and beverage industry [ edit ] 
 Dr Pepper  was founded in  Waco, Texas . The  Spoetzl Brewery  in  Shiner, Texas  is the oldest independent brewery in Texas, and produces Shiner Beers, including their flagship Shiner Bock. The  frozen margarita  machine was invented in  Dallas  by  Mariano Martinez . [ citation needed ] 
 Frito-Lay  is headquartered in  Plano, Texas  and  Frito pie , a dish of Texas chili topped with  corn chips  and cheese, is a popular recipe to serve at large events. [27] 
 Blue Bell Creameries  is a famous ice-cream manufacturer founded and headquartered in  Brenham, Texas . [4]
