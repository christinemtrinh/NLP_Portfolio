 Rajasthani cuisine (Hindi: राजस्थानी व्यञ्जन) is the cuisine of the rugged Rajasthan region in North West India. It was influenced by both the warlike lifestyles of its inhabitants and the availability of ingredients in an arid region.[1] Food that could last for several days and could be eaten without heating was preferred. Scarcity of water and fresh green vegetables have all had their effect on the cooking. It is also known for its snacks like Bikaneri bhujia, Mirchi bada and Pyaaj kachori. Other famous dishes include Dal Baati, malaidar special lassi (lassi) and Lashun ki chutney (hot garlic paste), Mawa lassi from Jodhpur, Alwar ka mawa, Malpauas from Pushkar and rasgulla from Bikaner, "paniya"and "gheriya" from Mewar.[1] Originating for the Marwar region of the state is the concept Marwari Bhojnalaya, or vegetarian  restaurants, today found in many parts of India, which offer vegetarian food of the Marwari people. The history also has its effect on the diet as the Rajputs preferred majorly a non-vegetarian diet while the Brahmin, Jains, and others preferred a vegetarian diet. So, the state has a myriad of both types of delicacies.[2]
 According to a 2014 survey released by the registrar general of India, Rajasthan has 74.9% vegetarians, which makes it the most vegetarian state in India.[3]
 Rajasthani cuisine is also influenced by the Rajputs, who are predominantly non-vegetarians. Their diet consisted of game meat and  dishes like Laal maas (meat in red gravy), Safed maas (meat in white gravy) and Jungli maas (game meat cooked with basic ingredients).[4][5][6]
 Sweet dishes are never referred to as 'dessert' in Rajasthan, because unlike desserts which are served after the meal, Rajasthani sweets are served before, during and after the meal.
