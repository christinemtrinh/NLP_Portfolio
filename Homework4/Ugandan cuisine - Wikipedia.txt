   Beef skewer barbecue 
 Ugandan  cuisine  consists of traditional and modern cooking styles, practices, foods and dishes in  Uganda , with  English ,  Arab , and  Asian  (especially  Indian ) influences.
 Many dishes include various  vegetables ,  potatoes ,  yams ,  bananas  and other  tropical fruits .
 Chicken ,  pork ,  fish  (usually fresh, but there is also a dried variety, reconstituted for stewing), [1]   beef  and  goat [1]  are all commonly eaten, although among the rural poor, meats are consumed less than in other areas, and mostly eaten in the form of  bushmeat .  Nyama  is the Luganda language word for "meat".
 
 
 Main dishes [ edit ] 
 Main dishes are usually centred on a  sauce  or  stew  of  simsim ,  groundnuts , beans or meat. The starch traditionally comes from  posho   ( maize  meal) or  matooke  (steamed and mashed green banana) in the central or millet bread (an  ugali  dish [1]  made from  millet ) in the north, east and west.  Posho  or millet is cooked as a  porridge  for breakfast.
 For main meals, white maize flour is added to the saucepan and stirred into the  posho  until the consistency is firm. It is then turned out onto a serving plate and cut into individual slices (or served onto individual plates in the kitchen).  Cassava ,  yam , [1]  and African  sweet potato  are also eaten; the more affluent include white (often called "Irish")  potato  and  rice  in their diets.  Soybeans  were promoted as a healthy food staple in the 1970s and this is also eaten, especially for breakfast.  Chapati , similar to Asian flatbreads, are also part of Ugandan cuisine.
 
 Fruits and vegetables [ edit ] 
 Various  leafy greens  are grown in Uganda. These may be boiled in the stews, or served as side dishes in fancier homes.  Amaranth  ( dodo ),  nakati , and  borr  are examples of regional greens.  Fruits  such as  mangoes ,  bananas  and  pineapples [1]  are plentiful and commonly consumed, whether cooked in foods or eaten alone as snacks or as a  dessert .
 
 Some traditional food names [ edit ] 
   Posho  or  ugali  consists of  maize  flour ( cornmeal ) cooked with water to a  porridge - or  dough -like consistency. Pictured on the bottom right of the plate, it is served with beef and sauce. 
 Some  traditional  and historic Ugandan foods include:
 
 Posho  or  kawunga— called  ugali  in  Kenya , it is usually made from maize but also other starches, regional names include  kwon . Ugandan expatriates make  posho  from  cornmeal ,  masa harina  or  grits .  Kwon  is a type of  ugali  made from millet (called  kalo  in western Uganda) but in other regions like eastern Uganda they include cassava flour. 
 Groundnuts  ( peanuts )—groundnuts are a vital staple and groundnut sauce is probably the most commonly eaten one. They are eaten plain or mixed with smoked fish, smoked meat or mushrooms, and can also be mixed with greens such as  borr . 
 Sim-sim  ( sesame )—a staple particularly in the north, roasted sesame paste is mixed into a stew of beans or greens and served as a side dish, though sesame paste may also be served as a  condiment ; a  candy  is made from roasted sesame seeds with sugar or honey. 
 Matooke —(green banana, not plantain) boiled or steamed (mashed) cooked in or served with a sauce of peanuts, beans, fresh fish or meat. 
 Luwombo —a traditional dish from Buganda, in which a stew of chicken, beef, mushrooms or fish is steamed in banana leaves. 
 Malewa —a traditional dish from eastern Uganda (Bugisu), made from bamboo shoots. 
 Kikomando —a  chapati  that is cut into pieces and served with fried beans. 
 Snacks [ edit ] 
   Roasted  peanuts 
 Roasted groundnuts (peanuts)—served in a spill of paper 
 Samusa  ( samousa ,  sumbusa ,  samosa )—Indian  samosas  are highly assimilated into the local cuisine, as are  chapati  and  curry 
 Mugaati n'amaggi  ( bread  and eggs)—Originally an  Arab  dish, it consists of  wheat  dough spread into a thin  pancake , filled with minced meat and raw  egg , and then folded into a neat parcel, which is fried on a skillet or hotplate. 
 Nsenene —a seasonal delicacy of a type of locust 
 Nswaa— served similarly to  nsenene , but made of  white ants [1] 
 Rolex — a  chapati  filled with  eggs ,  onions ,  cabbage  or  kale , and  tomatoes , though minced meat is sometimes added 
   Mandazi —a common Ugandan doughnut 
 Desserts [ edit ] 
 Fresh fruits—a common dessert 
 Simsim— very popular, made with sugar and sesame seeds [1] 
 Mandazi —doughnut, usually spiced with cardamon 
 Kabalagala —banana pancakes, usually made from very ripe  ndizi

 Beverages [ edit ] 
 Tea  ( chai ) and  coffee  ( kawa ) are popular beverages and important  cash crops . These can be served English-style or spiced ( chai masala ).  Coca-Cola ,  Pepsi  and  Fanta  have all made inroads in the Ugandan market and soft drinks have become very popular. Both traditional and Western  beers  are probably the most widely available  alcoholic beverages  across Uganda.
 Pombe  and  lubisi  are generic words for locally made fermented beer, usually from banana or millet. Fermented banana wine [1]  is also prepared and consumed.  Tonto  is a traditional  fermented drink  made from bananas. 
 Waragi  is the generic term for distilled spirits and these also vary, see for example  Uganda Waragi , a brand name for clear or yellow  gin .
