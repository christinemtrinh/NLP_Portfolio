   The coat of arms of the Transylvanian Saxons 
   Transylvanian Saxon household by painter  Albert Reich 
 The  Transylvanian Saxon cuisine  is the traditional cuisine of the  Transylvanian Saxons , a  German  ethnic group (mostly of  Luxembourgish  descent) which has been living in  Transylvania  ( Romanian :  Transilvania ,  German :  Siebenbürgen or Transsilvanien ) as well as in other parts on the territory of present-day  Romania  since the mid  12th century  onwards. [1]  It is a type of cuisine which, most notably, shares many similarities with the  Romanian cuisine  and  German cuisine , given the centuries-long mutual/reciprocal influence and cohabitation between the Saxons and  Romanians  in Transylvania, a historical region situated at the crossroads of  Central  and  Eastern Europe .
 
 
 Background [ edit ] 
 The traditional cuisine of the Transylvanian Saxons has evolved in Transylvania, contemporary Romania, through many centuries, being in contact with the Romanian cuisine but also with the Hungarian cuisine. At core, the Transylvanian Saxon cuisine is a type of German cuisine (therefore having Western European features) which managed to incorporate external culinary/gastronomical influences stemming from both the Romanian cuisine and the  Hungarian cuisine  as well along the passing of time. [2]  The aromatic herb of  tarragon  ( Romanian :  Tarhon ,  German :  Estragon ) was brought to Transylvania by the Transylvanian Saxons during the Middle Ages. [3]   Marjoram  is another important herb in the traditional cuisine of the Transylvanian Saxons. [4] 
 
 List of dishes [ edit ] 
 Some of the dishes which are part of the Transylvanian Saxon cuisine include: [5] 
 
 Hanklich (also known as 'Burgberger hanklich'); [6] 
 Apfelsuppe; 
 Brodelawend; 
 Palukes; 
 Kartoffelknodel. 
 In addition, there are many traditional Transylvanian Saxon pastries ( German :  Siebenbürgisches Kleingebäck ,  Transylvanian Saxon :  Siweberjesch Kliegebäk ) as well, most notably vanillekipferl or kipferl in general, the latter which can be filled with meat as well. [7]
