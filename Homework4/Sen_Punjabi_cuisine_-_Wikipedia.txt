This cuisine has a rich tradition of many distinct and local ways of cooking.
One is a special form of tandoori cooking that is now famous in other parts of Pakistan and India, England, Canada, America, and in many other parts of the world.
The local cuisine of Punjab is heavily influenced by the agriculture and farming lifestyle prevalent from the times of the ancient Indus Valley civilization.

[4] In India, tandoori cooking is traditionally associated with Punjab[5] as Punjabis embraced the tandoor on a regional level.
[6] This style of cooking became popular throughout India after the 1947 partition when Punjabis resettled in places such as Delhi.
According to Planalp (1971), "the Panjab-style underground oven known as tandur is becoming increasingly popular in New Delhi" pointing to the Punjabi style of the tandoor.

The hara is traditionally used to slow-heat milk or slow-cook pulses such as chickpeas.
[52] According to Ancient Pakistan - An Archaeological History by Mukhtar Ahmed,[53] Harappan oven structures may have operated in a similar manner to the modern tandoors of the Punjab.
The tandoor is traditionally made of clay and is a bell-shaped oven, set into the earth and fired with wood or charcoal reaching high temperatures.
According to Roy Hayter[54] the original versions of the tandoor "in the Punjab, a province in the north-west of India, were sunk neck deep in the ground".
He further states that modern versions can also rest above the ground.
Etiquette of eating is considered a major part of the cuisine.
Every Punjabi household follows certain regional etiquette.
The word etiquette has many local names depending on the particular region of Punjab.
Though certain etiquette varies regionally, there are many etiquette practices that are common throughout Punjab.

Watermelon and radish at food stalls are shared among friends and relatives.
The roadsides often serve as suburban eatery centers.
