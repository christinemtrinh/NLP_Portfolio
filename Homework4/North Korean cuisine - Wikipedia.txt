 Culinary traditions of North Korea 
 
 
   Various North Korean dishes and foods Some dishes are shared by the two Koreas; however, availability and quality of Northern cuisine is much more significantly affected by sociopolitical class divides.
 Historically,  Korean cuisine  has evolved through centuries of social and political change. Originating from ancient  agricultural and nomadic traditions  in southern  Manchuria  and the Korean Peninsula, it has gone through a complex interaction of the natural environment and different cultural trends. [1]   Rice dishes  and  kimchi  are  staple  Korean foods. In a traditional meal, they accompany both side dishes ( panch'an ) and main courses like  chuk  (porridge),  pulgogi  (grilled meat) or  myŏn  ( noodles ).  Soju  liquor is the best-known traditional Korean spirit. [2] 
 
 
 North Korean cuisine [ edit ] 
   P'yŏngyang - raengmyŏn  ( 평양랭면/평양냉면 ) is a cold noodle dish. 
 Some  North Korean  dishes and foods are also prepared in  South Korea , and many dishes that originated in North Korea were brought to South Korea by migrating families after the  Korean War . [3]  Many of these imported dishes became staples in the South Korean diet. [3] 
 In North Korea, some dishes vary in flavor compared to South Korean versions, with some North Korean dishes being less spicy and more varied in composition compared to South Korean preparations. [4] [5]  North Korean dishes have been described as having a specific tanginess that is derived from using ingredients with flavors of sweet, sour, pungent and spicy, in combinations that create this effect. [6] 
 Some  restaurants , particularly in  Pyongyang , have expensive pricing relative to average worker wages in North Korea. [7] [8]  Accessibility to restaurants is not always available to average North Korean citizens, with tourists and rich citizens being the primary patrons at some of them, particularly upscale ones. [7] [8]  Per their pricing, upscale restaurants are typically available only to well-paid leaders of the North Korean government, tourists visiting the country, and the emerging affluent middle class of  donju  in the country. [9] [10]   Donju  means "masters of money", and the  donju  typically hold positions in the government, positions operating state-owned businesses outside of the country, and positions involving bringing investments and the importation of products into the country. [11] [12] [13] [14] 
 Some  street foods  exist in North Korea, such as in Pyongyang, where vendors operate  food stalls . [15] [16] [17]  North Korea's first  pizzeria  opened in 2009. [18]   Alcoholic beverages  are produced and consumed in North Korea, and the country's legal drinking age is 18. [19]

[19]  Home brewed liquor is made using ingredients such as potatoes and corn. [19]  Some North Korean consumers purchase alcoholic beverages directly from alcohol-producing factories in the country, using cash.
