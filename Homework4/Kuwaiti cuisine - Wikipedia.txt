 Culinary traditions of Kuwait 
   Machboos 
 Kuwaiti cuisine  is a fusion of  Arabian ,  Iranian ,  Indian  and   Mediterranean  cuisines. [1] [2]  Kuwaiti cuisine is part of the  Eastern Arabian cuisine . A prominent dish in Kuwaiti cuisine is  machboos , a rice-based dish usually prepared with  basmati  rice seasoned with spices, and chicken or mutton.
 Seafood  is a significant part of the Kuwaiti diet, especially  fish . [3]   Mutabbaq samak  is a national dish in Kuwait. Other local favourites are  hamour  ( grouper ), which is typically served grilled, fried, or with  biryani  rice because of its texture and taste;  safi  ( rabbitfish );  maid  ( mulletfish ); and  sobaity  ( sea bream ).
 Kuwait's traditional  flatbread  is called Iranian  khubz . It is a large flatbread baked in a special oven and it is often topped with sesame seeds. Numerous local bakeries dot the country; the bakers are mainly Iranians (hence the name of the bread, "Iranian  khubuz "). Bread is often served with  mahyawa  fish sauce.
 There are many other cuisines available due to the international workforce in  Kuwait .
