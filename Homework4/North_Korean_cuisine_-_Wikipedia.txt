 Some dishes are shared by the two Koreas; however, availability and quality of Northern cuisine is much more significantly affected by sociopolitical class divides.
 Historically, Korean cuisine has evolved through centuries of social and political change. Originating from ancient agricultural and nomadic traditions in southern Manchuria and the Korean Peninsula, it has gone through a complex interaction of the natural environment and different cultural trends.[1] Rice dishes and kimchi are staple Korean foods. In a traditional meal, they accompany both side dishes (panch'an) and main courses like chuk (porridge), pulgogi (grilled meat) or myŏn (noodles). Soju liquor is the best-known traditional Korean spirit.[2]
 Some North Korean dishes and foods are also prepared in South Korea, and many dishes that originated in North Korea were brought to South Korea by migrating families after the Korean War.[3] Many of these imported dishes became staples in the South Korean diet.[3]
 In North Korea, some dishes vary in flavor compared to South Korean versions, with some North Korean dishes being less spicy and more varied in composition compared to South Korean preparations.[4][5] North Korean dishes have been described as having a specific tanginess that is derived from using ingredients with flavors of sweet, sour, pungent and spicy, in combinations that create this effect.[6]
 Some restaurants, particularly in Pyongyang, have expensive pricing relative to average worker wages in North Korea.[7][8] Accessibility to restaurants is not always available to average North Korean citizens, with tourists and rich citizens being the primary patrons at some of them, particularly upscale ones.[7][8] Per their pricing, upscale restaurants are typically available only to well-paid leaders of the North Korean government, tourists visiting the country, and the emerging affluent middle class of donju in the country.[9][10] Donju means "masters of money", and the donju typically hold positions in the government, positions operating state-owned businesses outside of the country, and positions involving bringing investments and the importation of products into the country.[11][12][13][14]
 Some street foods exist in North Korea, such as in Pyongyang, where vendors operate food stalls.[15][16][17] North Korea's first pizzeria opened in 2009.[18] Alcoholic beverages are produced and consumed in North Korea, and the country's legal drinking age is 18.[19]

 Alcoholic beverages are consumed in North Korea, and drinking is a part of the culture of North Korea.[47] North Korea's legal drinking age is 18, but minors are sometimes allowed to consume alcoholic beverages, and some shop keepers readily sell them alcoholic drinks.[19] Some North Koreans brew and distill alcoholic beverages at home, despite such home alcohol production being forbidden in North Korea, and some sell these beverages to markets, although this is also illegal.[19] Home brewed liquor is made using ingredients such as potatoes and corn.[19] Some North Korean consumers purchase alcoholic beverages directly from alcohol-producing factories in the country, using cash.[19] In recent times, imported Chinese liquor has been allowed to be sold in markets, and a well-known Chinese liquor purveyed in North Korea is Kaoliang Liquor, which has a 46-50% alcohol content.[19]
 North Korea has some bars and other drinking establishments, and in recent times, beer halls have become popular in Pyongyang.[48][49][19]
