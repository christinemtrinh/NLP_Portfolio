   Location of Catalonia in Spain   Location of Catalonia in Spain and  Europe . The majority of the Catalan territory is part of the  Mediterranean Basin , and its cuisine mainly belongs to the culinary tradition of this area. 
 Catalan cuisine  is the cuisine from  Catalonia . It may also refer to the shared cuisine of  Northern Catalonia  and  Andorra , the second of which has a similar cuisine to that of the neighbouring  Alt Urgell  and  Cerdanya   comarques  and which is often referred to as "Catalan mountain cuisine". [1]  It is considered a part of western  Mediterranean cuisine . [2] 
 
 
 History [ edit ] 
 There are several  Catalan language  cookbooks from the  Middle Ages  that are known to modern scholars. The  Llibre de Coch  [ es ]  (1520) was one of the most influential cookbooks of  Renaissance Spain . [3]  It includes several  sauce  recipes made with ingredients such as ginger,  mace  powder ( flor de macis ), cinnamon,  saffron , cloves ( clauells de girofle ), wine and honey. [4] [5]   Salsa de pagó  took its name from the  peacock  ( Catalan :  el paó ) that it was intended to be served with, but could accompany any type of poultry, and was part of the medieval  Christmas meal . [6]   Salsa mirraust  (or  mirausto alla catalana  as it's called in the  Cuoco Napoletano ) was half-roasted ( mi-raust ) poultry that was finished in a  salsa  thickened with egg yolks, toasted almonds and breadcrumbs. In the version of the recipe from the 14th-century  Llibre de Sent Soví  [ ast ] , the sauce is thickened with mashed poultry liver instead of egg yolks. [7] 
 Hippocras  ( pimentes de clareya ) was spiced wine made with cinnamon, cloves, ginger, pepper, honey and wine pressed through a  manega , a  pastry bag  shaped cloth that was originally designed by  Hippocrates  to filter water. [8] 
 
 Basic ingredients [ edit ] 
 Catalan cuisine relies heavily on  ingredients  popular along the  Mediterranean  coast, including fresh  vegetables  (especially  tomato ,  garlic ,  eggplant  (aubergine),  capsicum , and  artichoke ), wheat products ( bread ,  pasta ),  Arbequina   olive oils ,  wines , legumes ( beans ,  chickpeas ),  mushrooms  (particularly wild mushrooms), nuts (pine nuts, hazelnuts and almonds), all sorts of  pork  preparations ( sausage  from  Vic ,  ham ), sheep and goats'  cheese ,  poultry ,  lamb , many types of  fish  like  sardine ,  anchovy ,  tuna , and  cod   [9]  and other seafood like  prawns ,  squid ,  sea snails  and  sea urchins .
 Traditional Catalan cuisine is quite diverse, ranging from pork-intensive dishes cooked in the inland part of the region (Catalonia is one of the main  producers of swine products  in Spain) to fish-based recipes along the coast. [10]  These meat and seafood elements are frequently fused together in the Catalan version of  surf and turf , known as  mar i muntanya . Examples include chicken with lobster ( pollastre amb llagosta ), chicken with crayfish ( pollastre amb escarmalans ), rice with meat and seafood ( arròs mar i muntanya ) and cuttlefish with meatballs ( sipia amb mandonguilles ).
 The cuisine includes many preparations that mix sweet and savoury and stews with sauces based upon  botifarra  (pork  sausage ) and the characteristic  picada  (ground  almonds ,  hazelnuts ,  pine nuts , etc. sometimes with  garlic ,  herbs ,  biscuits ). [9]

It is an ancient pre-Christian tradition which marked the passage from childhood to the adult world.

 Main articles:  Catalan wine  and  Spanish wine regions 
 There are 11 Catalan wine-growing regions qualified by the INCAVI (The Catalan Institute of Wine):  Priorat ,  Penedès ,  Catalunya ,  Costers del Segre ,  Conca de Barberà ,  Montsant ,  Alella ,  Tarragona ,  Empordà , Pla del Bages and  Terra Alta .

However, Catalan  moscatell  is thicker than French  muscat  and is not drunk before the meal ( aperitiu ) but after it, either with or after dessert.
 
 Alternative views [ edit ] 
 Some Catalan authors, such as  Josep Pla , [14]   Jaume Fàbrega [15]  or Eliana Thibaut i Comalada, [16]  and others like  Colman Andrews , [17]  have suggested that, besides Catalonia proper, this cuisine takes in the Balearic and Valencian cuisines, [18]  but this opinion is challenged as politicised, and is not widespread, nor is it supported by either the  Balearic  or the  Valencian government , [19] [20]  while the Catalan government itself provides divergent points of view. [21] [22]  In any case, mutual ties do exist between Catalan gastronomy and other western Mediterranean gastronomies, such as  Balearic cuisine ,  Valencian cuisine ,  Southern French cuisine ,  Aragonese cuisine  or Murcian cuisine.
