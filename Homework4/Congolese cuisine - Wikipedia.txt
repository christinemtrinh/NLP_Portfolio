 Common Congolese dishes [ edit ] 
   Mangoes, available all year round 
   Moambe chicken  is the national dish of the Congos 
   Loso ya boulayi ,  ntaba ,  mipanzi ,  kwanga ,  makemba et salade 
 Less than two percent of the land is cultivated, and most of this is used for subsistence farming. Congo's farmland is the source of a wide variety of crops. These include  maize ,  rice ,  cassava  (manioc),  sweet potatoes ,  yam ,  taro ,  plantain ,  tomatoes ,  pumpkin  and varieties of  peas  and  nuts . [2]  These foods are eaten throughout the country, but there are also regional dishes. The most important crops for export are  coffee  and  palm oil .
 
   Sakamadesu  ( Tshakamadesu) 
 Wild  plants, [3]   fruits ,  mushrooms , [3]   honey  and other foods such as  bushmeat  and  fish  are also gathered, hunted, and used in dishes. [3]  People often sell these crops at markets, or by the roadside. Cattle breeding and the development of large-scale agricultural businesses has been hindered by the recent war and the poor quality of the road system.

   Congolese street food - Smoked meat 
   Madesu 
 Congolese meals often consist of a  starchy  ingredient, along with  vegetables  and  meat  in the form of a  stew . The starch can come in the form of a paste or mash made of cassava or corn flour, called  fufu  or  ugali . When eaten, the  fufu  is rolled into golf ball-sized balls and dipped into the spicy stew—often an indentation is made with the thumb in order to bring up a thimbleful of sauce.
 A type of fermented  bread ,  kwanga , made from cassava, is commercially produced throughout the country.  Lituma  is a popular plantain dish made from mashed plantains which are formed into balls and baked. Sweet potatoes are prepared in a similar way, and mixed with roasted peanuts in some parts of the country. Rice is often mixed with beans.
 To accompany these starchy ingredients,  green vegetables  such as cassava leaves,  tshitekutaku  (a  spinach -like plant) and  okra  are often added.  Mushrooms , especially prized amongst the  Luba people , are often seen as a substitute for meat in times of shortage. Though total  vegetarianism  is unknown, most meals are eaten without meat due to its high price.
 Fish  are plentiful along the  Congo River , its tributaries, and various lakes, and are baked, boiled or fried for immediate consumption, or smoked or salted when preserved. Markets often sell ready-to-eat peppered fish baked in  banana  leaves.  Goat  is the most widely consumed meat. [3]   Mwambe  is a common way of cooking  chicken  with  peanut  sauce. [3]  Edible insects such as  grasshoppers  and  caterpillars  are eaten; [3]  they tend to have a nutty flavour.
 Sauces  to mix with the ingredients above can be made with tomatoes,  onions , and the local aromatic  herbs .  Vegetable oil , together with  salt , hot red  chile pepper  and sweet green  pepper  are used to impart extra flavour. These  spices  are less frequently used in the far south.
 
 Nganda  restaurants [ edit ] 
 Kinshasa's  nganda   restaurants , with a greater mix of ethnicities, are ethnic restaurants serving food from specific parts of the country, as well as Western imports such as bread and  beer . [4]  Often owned by unmarried women, the  nganda  occupy a middle ground between  bars  and  restaurants . Three typical types of  nganda  restaurants are:
 
 Riverside  nganda  serve baked fish served with cooked plantains: recipes from up river. 
 Kongo  nganda  serve fish dishes with a vegetable sauce, together with  kwanga  mentioned above. These dishes originate downriver from Kinshasa. 
 Kasai  nganda  serve goat meat with rice and green vegetables. They also use rabbit as the grand dessert at a special occasion. 
 Nganda  restaurants are often geared not only to specific regions, but also different classes—from migrant menial workers and miners, to professionals and government officials.
