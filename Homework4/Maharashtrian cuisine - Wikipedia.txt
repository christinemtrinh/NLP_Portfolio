 Maharashtrian  or  Marathi   cuisine  is the  cuisine  of the  Marathi people  from the  Indian state  of  Maharashtra . It has distinctive attributes, while sharing much with other  Indian cuisines . Traditionally,  Maharashtrians  have considered their food to be more austere than others.
 Maharashtrian cuisine includes mild and spicy dishes.  Wheat ,  rice ,  jowar ,  bajri ,  vegetables ,  lentils  and  fruit  are dietary  staples .  Peanuts  and  cashews  are often served with vegetables.  Meat  was traditionally used sparsely or only by the well off until recently, because of economic conditions and culture.
 The urban population in metropolitan cities of the state has been influenced by cuisine from other parts of India and abroad. For example, the South Indian dishes  idli  and  dosa ,  as well as  Chinese  and Western dishes such as pizza, are quite popular in home cooking, and in restaurants.
 Distinctly Maharashtrian dishes include  ukdiche  modak ,  aluchi patal bhaji , Kande pohe and  Thalipeeth .
 
 
 Regular meals and staple dishes [ edit ]

   Regions and districts of Maharashtra 
   Varan bhat in Maharashtrian house 
 Since they occupy a vast area with distinct geographical differences and food availability, the Marathi people from different regions have produced a diverse cuisine. The diversity extends to the family level because each family uses its own unique combination of spices and ingredients. The majority of Maharashtrians are not averse to eating meat, fish and eggs, but the staple diet for most people is mostly  lacto-vegetarian . Many communities such as the  brahmins  and  varkari  sect members only follow the lacto-vegetarian diet.
 The traditional staple food on Desh (the  Deccan plateau ) is usually  bhakri , spiced cooked vegetables,  dal  and rice. However, North Maharashtrians and urbanites prefer  roti  or  chapati , which is a plain bread made with  wheat .
 In the coastal  Konkan  region, rice is the traditional staple food. Wet  coconut  and coconut milk are used in many dishes. Marathi communities indigenous to Mumbai and North Konkan have their own distinct cuisine. [note 1]  In South Konkan, near  Malvan , another independent cuisine developed called  Malvani cuisine , which is predominantly non-vegetarian.  Kombdi vade , fish preparations and baked preparations are more popular there.
 In the  Vidarbha  region, little coconut is used in daily preparations but dry coconut and peanuts are used in dishes such as spicy  savji s, as well as in mutton and chicken dishes.
 Maharashtrian lacto-vegetarian dishes are based on five main classes of ingredients that include grains, legumes, vegetables, dairy products and spices. [1] 
 
 Grains [ edit ] 
   Grains of Jwari ( Sorghum bicolor ) 
   Grains of bajri(pearl millet) 
 Staple dishes in the cuisine are based on a variety of  flatbreads  and  rice . Flatbreads can be wheat-based, such as the traditional trigonal  ghadichi poli   [2]  or the round  chapati  that is more common in urban areas. Bhakri is an  unleavened bread  made using grains such as  ragi  or  millet ,  bajra  or  bajri or   jwari  and forms part of daily meals in rural areas. [3] [4] 
 
 Millets [ edit ] 
 Traditionally, the staple grains of the inland  Deccan plateau  have been millets,  jwari   [5] [6]  and  bajri . [7] [8]  These crops grow well in this dry and drought-prone region. In the coastal Konkan region the finger millet called  ragi  is used for  bhakri . [9] [10]  The staple meal of the rural poor was traditionally as simple as  bajra  bhakri  accompanied by just a raw onion, a dry  chutney , or a  gram flour  preparation called  jhunka . [11] [12]  Jhunka with bhakri has now become a popular street food in Maharashtra. [13] 
 
 Wheat [ edit ] 
 Increased urbanization of the Maharashtra region has increased wheat's popularity. [14]  Wheat is used for making flatbreads called  chapati , trigonal  ghadichi poli  , [2]  the deep-fried version called  puri  or the thick  paratha . Wheat is also used in many stuffed flatbreads such as the  Puran poli , Gul poli (with sesame and Jaggery stuffing), [15]  and satorya (with sugar and  khoya  (dried milk)).

 Wheat flatbreads are also made with vegetable stuffings such as peas, potatoes and Gram dal. [16]  One of the ancient sought-after breads was Mande. [17]  As with rice, flatbreads accompany a meal of vegetables or dairy items.
 
 Rice [ edit ] 
 Rice is the staple food in the rural areas of coastal Konkan region but is also popular in all urban areas. [5]  Local varieties such as the fragrant  ambemohar  have been popular in Western Maharashtra.
In most instances, rice is boiled on its own and becomes part of a meal that includes other items. A popular dish is  varan bhaat  where steamed rice is mixed with plain  dal  that is prepared with  pigeon peas , lemon juice, salt and ghee. [18] [19]   Khichdi  is a popular rice dish made with rice, mung  dal  and spices. For special occasions, a dish called  masalebhat  made with rice, spices and vegetables is popular. [20] 
 
 Dairy [ edit ] 
 Milk is important as a staple food. [21]  Both cow milk and  water buffalo  milk are popular. Milk is used mainly for drinking, to add to tea or coffee or to make homemade  dahi  (yogurt). Traditionally, yogurt is made every day using previous day's yogurt as the starting bacterial culture to ferment the milk. The Dahi is used as dressing for many salad or  koshimbir  dishes, to prepare  Kadhi , to prepare cultured buttermilk ( Taak ) or as a side dish in a  thali . [22]  Buttermilk is used in a drink called  mattha  by mixing it with spices. [23]  It may also be used in curry preparations. [24]  Milk is also the prerequisite ingredient for  butter  and  Ghee  (clarified butter).
 
 Vegetables [ edit ] 
   Common vegetables used as seen on a market cart in  Pune . Top row from left, Sweet potatoes, Awala,  winter radish :Middle row from left  Guar  pods,  Bhendi , carrots far right; bottom row,  pavta 
   Aloo (आळू), a popular leafy vegetable 
 Until recently, canned or frozen food was not widely available in India. Therefore, the vegetables used in a meal widely depended on seasonal availability. In Maharashtra, spring (March–May) is the season of cabbages, onions, potatoes,  okra ,  guar  and  tondali , [25]   shevgyachya shenga ,  dudhi , marrow and  padwal . During the Monsoon season (June–September) green leafy vegetables, such as  aloo  ( Marathi : आळू), or gourds such as  karle ,  dodka  and  eggplant  become available. Chili peppers, carrots, tomatoes,  cauliflower ,  French beans  and peas become available in the cooler climate of October to February. [26] 
Coal fired roasted young cobs of Sorghum (Jwari) is a popular item during winter picnics to the farms. [27] 
Vegetables are typically used in making  bhaaji s (Indian stew). Some  bhaaji s are made with a single vegetable, while others are made with a combination. Bhaajis can be "dry" such as  stir fry  or "wet" as in the well-known curry. For example,  fenugreek  leaves can be used with   mung  dal  or potatoes to make a dry  bhhaji  or mixed with  besan  flour and buttermilk to make a curry preparation. [28]   Bhaaji  requires the use of  goda  masala , consisting of a combination of onion, garlic, ginger, red chilli powder, green chillies, turmeric and  mustard seeds . [29] [30]  Depending on a family's caste or specific religious tradition, onions and garlic may be excluded. For example, a number of Hindu communities from many parts of India refrain from eating onions and garlic altogether during  chaturmas , which broadly equals the  monsoon  season. [31] 
 Leafy vegetables such as fenugreek,  amaranth ,  beetroot ,  radish ,  dill ,  colocasia ,  spinach ,  ambadi ,  sorrel  (Chuka in Marathi),  chakwat ,  safflower  (Kardai in Marathi) and  tandulja  are either stir-fried (pale  bhaaji  ) or made into a soup ( patal bhaaji  ) [32]  using buttermilk and gram flour. [33] [34] [35] 
 Many vegetables are used in salad preparations called  koshimbir s or  raita . [36] [37] [38]  Most of these have  dahi  (yogurt) as the other main ingredient. Popular  Koshimbir s include those based on radish,  cucumber  and tomato-onion combinations. [39]  Many  raita  require prior boiling or roasting of the vegetable as in the case of  eggplant . Popular  raita  include those based on carrots, eggplant,  pumpkin ,  dudhi  and  beetroot  respectively.
 
 Legumes [ edit ] 
   Sprouted mung beans 
 Along with green vegetables, another class of popular food is various beans, either whole or split. Split beans are called  dal  and turned into  amti  (thin lentil soup), or added to vegetables such as  dudhi .  Dal  may be cooked with rice to make  khichadi . Whole beans are cooked as is or more popularly soaked in water until sprouted. Unlike Chinese cuisine, the beans are allowed to grow for only a day or two. Curries made out of sprouted beans are called  usal  and form an important source of proteins. [40]  The legumes popular in Maharastrian cuisine include peas,  chick peas ,  mung ,  matki ,  urid , kidney bean,  black-eyed peas ,  kulith [41]  and toor (also called  pigeon peas ). [42]  Out of the above toor and chick peas are staples. [5] [43]  The urid bean is the base for one of the most popular types of  papadum [44] '.
 
 Oils and fats [ edit ] 
 Peanut oil [45]  and  sunflower oil  are the preferred cooking oils, however  cottonseed oil  is also used. [46]  Clarified butter (called  ghee ) is often used for its distinct flavor. It is served with  Puran poli ,  Varan bhaat , chapati and many other dishes. Fresh home made butter is usually served with bhakri.
 
 Spices and herbs [ edit ] 
   Curry leaves are popular for garnishing many dishes Depending on region, religion and caste, Maharashtrian food can be mild to extremely spicy. Common spices include  asafoetida ,  turmeric ,  mustard seeds ,  coriander ,  cumin , dried  bay leaves , and  chili powder . Ingredients used especially for kala or black masala spice blend include  cinnamon ,  cloves , black pepper,  cardamom  and  nutmeg . [47]  Other spice blends popular in the cuisine include goda masala and Kolhapuri masala. [48]  Common herbs to impart flavor or to garnish a dish include  curry leaves , and  coriander  leaves. Many common curry recipes call for  garlic ,  onion ,  ginger  and green chilli pepper. Ingredients that impart  sour flavor  to the food include yoghurt,  tomatoes ,  tamarind  paste, lemon, and  amsul  skin. [49]  or unripe mangoes. [50] [51] 
 Meat and poultry [ edit ] 
   Maharashtrian Non Veg thaali 
 Chicken  and  goat  are the most popular sources for meat in Maharashtrian cuisine. Eggs are popular and exclusively come from chicken sources. Beef and pork are also consumed by some sections  of Maharashtrian society. [52]  However, these do not form part of traditional Maharashtrian cuisine.
 
 Seafood [ edit ] 
   Bangda  or Indian Mackerel 
 Seafood  is  a staple for many  Konkan  coastal communities and is popular in other parts of the state too. [53]  Most of the recipes are based on  marine fish ,  prawns  and  crab . A distinct  Malvani cuisine  of mainly seafood dishes is popular. Popular fish varieties include  Bombay duck , [54]   pomfret ,  bangda ,  Rawas , and  surmai  (kingfish). Seafood recipes are prepared in different ways such as curried,  Pan frying , or steaming in  banana leaves . [55] 
 
 Miscellaneous ingredients [ edit ] 
 Other ingredients include oil seeds such as  flax ,  karale , [56] [57]  coconut, peanuts, almonds and cashew nuts. Peanut powder and whole nuts are used in many preparations including,  chutney , koshimbir and bhaaji. More expensive nuts such as (almonds and cashew) are used mainly for sweet dishes. Flax and  karale  seeds are used in making dry chutneys. [58]  Traditionally, sugar cane based  jaggery  was used as the sweetening agent, but has been largely replaced by refined  cane sugar . Fruit such as mango are used in many preparations including pickles, jams, drinks and sweet dishes. Bananas and  jackfruit 
are also used in many dishes.
 
 Typical menus [ edit ] 
 Urban menus typically have wheat in the form of chapatis and plain rice as the main staples. Traditional rural households would have millet in form of  bhakri  on the Deccan plains and rice on the coast as respective staples. [59] 
 Typical breakfast items include  misal ,  pohe ,  upma ,  sheera ,  sabudana khichadi  and  thalipeeth . In some households leftover rice from the previous night is fried with onions, turmeric and mustard seeds for breakfast, making  phodnicha bhat . Typical Western breakfast items such as cereals, sliced bread and eggs, as well as South Indian items such as  idli  and  dosa  are also popular. Tea or coffee is served with breakfast.
 
 Urban lunch and dinner menus [ edit ] 
   A Maharashtrian vegetarian meal with a variety of items 
 Vegetarian lunch and dinner plates in urban areas carry a combination of:
 
 Wheat flatbread such as round  chapati  or  ghadichi poli  (layered triangular chapati) 
 Boiled rice 
 Salad or  koshimbir  based on onions, tomatoes or cucumber 
 Papad  or related snacks such as  sandge ,  kurdaya  and  sabudana papdya [60] 
 Dry or fresh chutney, mango or lemon  pickles 
 Aamti  or  varan  soup based on  toor dal , other  dal s or  kadhi . When  usal  is part of the menu, the  aamti  may be omitted. 
 Vegetables with gravy based on seasonal availability such as egg plants,  okra , potatoes, or cauliflower 
 Dry leafy vegetables such as spinach 
 Usal  based on  sprouted  or unsprouted whole legumes 
 Apart from bread, rice, and chutney, other items may be substituted. Families that eat meat, fish and poultry may combine vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes, with rice and chapatis remaining the staples. Vegetable or non-vegetable items are essentially dips for the bread or for mixing with rice.
 Traditional dinner items are arranged in a circular way. With salt placed at  12 o'clock , pickles,  koshimbir  and condiments are placed anti-clockwise of the salt. Vegetable preparations are arranged in a clockwise fashion with a sequence of leafy greens curry, dry vegetables, sprouted been curry ( usal  ) and  dal . Rice is always on the periphery rather than in the center. [32] 
 
 Rural lunch and dinner menus [ edit ] 
   A typical simple Maharashtrian meal with bhaaji, bhakari, raw onion and pickle 
 In the inland areas of Maharashtra such as  Desh ,  Khandesh ,  Marathwada  and  Vidarbha , the traditional staple was  bhakri  with a combination of  dal , vegetables, or commonly the chickpea flour based  pithale . The  bhakri  is increasingly replaced by wheat-based chapatis. [14] 
 In the Konkan coastal area, boiled rice and  rice bhakri ,  nachni bhakri  is the staple, with a combination of the vegetable and non-vegetable dishes described in the lunch and dinner menu.
 
 Methods and equipment [ edit ] 
   Maharashtrian kitchen 
 Open stove  cooking is the most commonly used cooking method. The traditional three-stone  chulha  has largely been replaced by  kerosene  or  gas stoves . A stove may be used for cooking in many different ways:
 
   A Maharashtrian kitchen in rural part of Maharashtra in 2011 
 Phodani  – Often translated as "tempering", is a cooking technique and garnish where spices such as mustard seeds, cumin seeds, turmeric, and sometimes other ingredients such as minced ginger and garlic are fried briefly in oil or  ghee  to liberate essential oils from cells and thus enhance their flavours. Other ingredients such as vegetables and meat are then added to the pan. [61] [62]   Phodani  may be the first step in making a  bhaaji ,  aamti  or curry. It may also be the last step, as part of a  garnish . 
 Simmering  – Most curries and  bhaaji s are simmered for the meat or vegetables to cook 
 Deep frying  – This is used for making fritters such as onion bhaji, or sweet fried dumplings ( karanji ) 
 Pan frying  – This is characterized by the use of minimal cooking oil or fat (compared to shallow frying or deep frying); typically using just enough oil to lubricate the pan. This method is used for cooking delicate items such as fish. 
 Tawa  – This is usually a concave metal pan used on an open stove for making unleavened flatbreads such as  ghadichi poli ,  chapatis  or  bhakri s. 
 Steaming  – This method is mainly used for specialties such as  ukadiche  modak , or  aluchya  wadya . 
 Roasting  –  Vangyache bharit  involves roasting eggplant over open fire prior to mashing and adding other ingredients. [63] 
 Pressure cooking  – This technique is used extensively for shortening the cooking time for lentils, meat and rice. 
 Other methods of food preparation include:
 
 Baking  – Baking is seldom used at home. The bread buns or  pav  used in popular street foods such as  vadapav  are baked by commercial bakers. 
 Sun drying –  Papad , a popular snack, and related products called  papdya  and  kurdaya , are dried in the sun after rolling out. The dried products keep for many months. [64] 
 Fermentation  – This is used mainly for making  dahi  (yogurt) or home-made butter from cream-enriched milk., [65] [66] [67] 
 Special dishes [ edit ] 
   Puran poli 
 A number of dishes are made for religious occasions, dinner parties or as restaurant items or street food. [68]

 ^   Fish Koliwada is not part of traditional Maharashtrian cuisine, however, it is an iconic appetizer from Mumbai created by the Singh brothers, Bahadur and Hakam in the 1950s. In 1955, Bahadur Singh along with his brother Hakam Singh folded up their small dhaba near Delhi–Uttar Pradesh highway and moved to Sion in Mumbai where many from his community had already taken shelter after the Partition of India. The brothers started selling the fried fish from a bare-boned makeshift stall. The popularity of their crispy fried-fish led to their first eatery at Sion Koliwada in 1970, aptly named Mini Punjab.
