   Luqaimat  ( lugaimat  in  Emirati dialect ), a traditional Emirati dessert, served with  Arabic coffee . 
 Emirati cuisine  ( Arabic :  المطبخ الإماراتي ) is the local traditional Arabic cuisine of the  United Arab Emirates . It is part of the  Eastern Arabian cuisine  and shares similarities with cuisines from neighboring countries, such as  Omani cuisine  and  Saudi Arabian cuisine , as well as influences from different  Middle Eastern  and  Asian  cuisines. 
 As a major international hub, the United Arab Emirates today has a  multicultural  and variety of cuisines from different parts of the world.
 
 
 History [ edit ] 
 Origins [ edit ] 
 See also:  History of the United Arab Emirates 
 Cultivation of  date palms  in the area can be traced back to the mid-third millennium BC (commonly referred to as the Umm al-Nar period in the United Arab Emirates) from which many date seeds have been found in  Umm al-Nar sites . The presence of grinding stones and fired clay ovens in archaeological sites indicate that grain processing was also performed. Studies of human dental remains dating back to the third millennium shows a high level of attrition which is believed to result from the mastication of dry bread. [1] 
 
 Modern history [ edit ] 
 The cuisine which originated in the area that is now the United Arab Emirates and was previously the  Trucial States  is formed by a similar Arabic and Middle Eastern cuisine which is consumed in the wider  Arabian Peninsula . The food is a mixture of a  bedouin  diet, consisting of  meat  and  camel milk , a fishermen's diet, consisting mainly of fish common in the Persian gulf, and a farmer's diet, consisting mainly of  dates . A blend of these diets as well as a mixture of spices such as  cinnamon ,  saffron , and  turmeric  formed the basis of the common dishes consumed in the Trucial states region and the current traditional Emirati cuisine. [2] 
 The  traditional food  of the United Arab Emirates uses much  meat ,  grain , and  dairy .  Vegetables  that are easy to grow in fertile soil, such as  cucumbers  and  tomatoes , are strongly featured in the diet. Dried lemons, called  loomi , are also heavily featured, grown locally, and used in most dishes.  Mangos  are also grown, usually in the northern emirates in villages such as  Masafi . Meats traditionally used are  chicken  or small  fowl , such as Houbara bustards, and goats. As camels are highly prized for their milk and transporting ability, the eating of  camel meat  is normally reserved for special occasions.
 The dishes are usually like stews, as everything is often cooked in a single pot.  Saffron ,  cardamom ,  turmeric , and  thyme  are the core flavors used in Emirati cookery.  Rice  was added to the diet when traders moved to the region. [ when? ]  Leaves from indigenous trees, such as the Ghaff, were also used to stuff small birds for enhanced flavor.
 Traditional dishes include  Maq'louba ,  Margooga ,  Harees ,  Machbous ,  Frsee'ah ,  Fireed ,  Jisheid , and  Mishwy. 
 Breakfast  in the UAE usually features breads like  raqaq ,  khameer , and  chebab , served with  cheese ,  date syrup , or  eggs . These were made over a curved hot plate, resembling a stone, which would have been used by the  Bedouins .  Balaleat  is another dish, but its advent began with the traders, who introduced  pasta .
 Sweet options include  luqeymat , a deep fried ball of  pancake  batter that is rolled in  sesame seeds  and then drizzled with  date honey . Other desserts include  khabeesa , which is flour bread crumbs blended with  sugar ,  cardamom , and  saffron  or bethitha, a semolina blended with crushed  dates ,  cardamom , and  clarified butter .
 At the close of the meal, it is usual to serve a red tea infused with  mint  as a digestive. Other mealtime traditions include a welcome with  dates  and  gahwah  ( Arabic coffee ), which are offered on arrival and are kept available through the guests visit.
 Levantine cuisine  is sometimes confused as Emirati/Gulf, but  shawarma ,  hummous ,  tabbouleh  and mixed grill, whilst having similar characteristics, are fairly recent additions to the Emirati diet. [ citation needed ]

 Seafood  has been the mainstay of the Emirati diet for centuries. [3]  The United Arab Emirates cuisine is a reflection of an Arabian heritage and exposure to other civilizations over time. As the consumption of  pork  is forbidden under Muslim law, it is not included in most menus. Hotels frequently have pork substitutes such as beef, chicken, sausage and veal rashers on their breakfast menus. If pork is available, it is clearly labelled as such.
 Meat ,  fish , and  rice  are the staple foods of the Emirati cuisine.  Lamb and mutton  are the more favored meats rather than  goat ,  beef , and  camel meat .  Dates  are usually consumed with meals.
 Popular beverages are  coffee  and  tea , which can be supplemented with  cardamom ,  saffron , or  mint  to give it a distinct flavor. [4] 
 Alcohol  is generally only served in hotel restaurants and bars (but not in  Sharjah ). All nightclubs and golf clubs are permitted to sell alcohol. Specific supermarkets may sell pork in a separate section of the market. [5]
