 Northern Irish cuisine  encompasses the cooking styles, traditions and recipes associated with  Northern Ireland . It has distinctive attributes of its own, but has also drawn heavily from  Irish  and  British cuisines .
 
 
 History [ edit ] 
 Northern Ireland's culinary heritage has its roots in the staple diet of generations of farming families: bread and potatoes. [1]   Historically, limited availability of ingredients and low levels of immigration resulted in restricted variety and relative isolation from wider international culinary influences. [ citation needed ] 
 Recent decades, however, have seen significant developments in the local cuisine, characterised by an increase in the variety, quantity and quality of  gastropubs  and  restaurants . There are currently three  Michelin-starred  restaurants in Northern Ireland, all of which specialise in traditional dishes made using local ingredients. [2] 
 Northern Irish cuisine received international attention in March 2018 when it was reported that  Prince Harry  and  Meghan Markle  had  Irish stew  and sausage with  champ  for lunch at the  Crown Liquor Saloon  during a tour of  Belfast . [3] 
 
 Dishes and foods [ edit ] 
 Ardglass potted herring [ edit ] 
 Ardglass potted herring is found in butcher's shops and fish traders. It is  herring  that is  marinated  in vinegar, rolled with bay leaf and baked with breadcrumbs.
 
 Breads [ edit ] 
 Potato bread [ edit ] 
 Potato bread  is a flat bread prepared with potato, flour, and buttermilk. [4]  It is cooked on a griddle. [4] 
 
 Soda bread [ edit ] 
   A  soda bread farl 
 Soda bread  is one of Northern Ireland's griddle breads; it can be eaten straightaway, or cooked until golden in an  Ulster fry . They are sometimes eaten with butter and homemade jam, or with savoury food such as smoked salmon, fresh fried eel, or thick dry-cured bacon.
 Soda bread is a soft, thick and fluffy bread. It was first baked in the 1800s in Ireland, and local people used  baking soda  to cause the dough to rise. It is typically served with an Ulster fry. [4] 
 
 Wheaten bread [ edit ] 
 Wheaten bread is a brown bread made with whole wheat flour which also uses baking soda as a rising agent. It is often sweetened in contrast to the savoury white soda bread. [4] 
 
 Veda bread [ edit ] 
 Veda bread  is a small, soft, caramel-colored, malted loaf, typically eaten as a slice with a cup of  tea . Veda is often toasted and/or served with butter or margarine.
 
 Fifteens [ edit ] 
 A soft tray bake cake which gets its name from using  fifteen  of each main ingredient (marshmallows, digestive biscuits, cherries).
 
 Boxty [ edit ] 
 Boxty , mainly found in County Fermanagh, is a weighty, starchy potato cake made with a 50:50 mix of cooked mashed potatoes and grated, strained, raw potato. The most common variety is boiled boxty, also known as hurley, a large round loaf which is boiled whole for several hours, allowed to rest and then sliced and fried, often with bacon.
 
 Champ [ edit ] 
 Champ  is made with potatoes  mashed with milk and chopped  scallions . [4] 
 
 Vegetable soup [ edit ] 
 A vegetable soup made throughout Ulster contains  carrots ,  celery , thin  leeks  and  parsley , thickened with  red lentils  and  barley . Packets of these six ingredients are often sold together as “soup veg”. [4] 
 
 Dulse [ edit ] 
 Dulse  is a  seaweed   snack food . Originally, it was harvested by fishermen for income supplementation when fishing was meager. [4] 
 
 Pasties [ edit ] 
 Pasties  are made from a mixture of sausage meat, onions, and mashed potato, shaped like a burger and spiced with black pepper. They can be ordered battered from most chip shops.
 
 Ulster fry [ edit ] 
   A full  Ulster fry  served in  Belfast 
 The best known traditional dish in Northern Ireland is the  Ulster fry . An Ulster fry, although not originally particularly associated with breakfast time, has in recent decades been marketed as Northern Ireland's version of a cooked breakfast. It is distinguishable from a  full breakfast  by its griddle breads—soda bread and potato bread, fried (or occasionally grilled) until crisp and golden, and sometimes also includes small pancakes. Bacon, sausages, an egg, and (as a modern development) tomato and sometimes mushrooms complete the dish. It is usually served with tea and toast.
 
 Yellowman [ edit ] 
 Yellowman  is a crunchy golden confectionery and looks a bit like honeycomb. It is mainly sold at fairs and markets.
 
 Beverages [ edit ] 
 Bushmills whiskey 
 Brown lemonade 
 McDaid's Football Special 
 Punjana  tea 
 Nambarrie  tea [5]
