   Potica  pastry as part of traditional Slovenian Easter breakfast 
 Slovenian cuisine  ( Slovene :  slovenska kuhinja ) is influenced by the diversity of  Slovenia 's landscape, climate, history and neighbouring cultures. In 2016, the leading Slovenian ethnologists divided the country into 24 gastronomic regions. [1] : 15    
The first Slovene-language cookbook was published by  Valentin Vodnik  in 1798.
 
 
 Foods and dishes [ edit ] 
   Plate of various sorts of Slovenian cheese and meat together with garnish 
 Soups are a relatively recent invention in Slovenian cuisine, but there are over 100. Earlier there were various kinds of porridge, stew and one-pot meals. The most common soups without meat were lean and plain. A typical dish is  aleluja , a soup made from turnip peels and a well-known dish during fasting. The most common meat soup is beef soup with noodles, which is often served on Sunday as part of a Sunday lunch (beef soup, fried potatoes, fried steak and lettuce). On feast days and holidays there is often a choice of beef noodle soup or creamy mushroom soup.
Pork is popular and common everywhere in Slovenia. Poultry is also often popular. There is a wide variety of meats in different parts of Slovenia. In  White Carniola  and the  Slovenian Littoral  mutton and goat are eaten. On  St. Martin's Day  people feast on roasted goose, duck, turkey, or chicken paired with red cabbage and mlinci. In Lower Carniola and  Inner Carniola , they used to eat roasted dormouse and quail. Until the  crayfish plague  in the 1880s the  noble crayfish  was a source of income and often on the menu in Lower Carniola and Inner Carniola.
 Dandelion  is popular as a salad ingredient in Slovenia and has been gathered in the fields for centuries. Even today dandelion and potato salad is highly valued. Since it can be picked only for a short time in early spring, much is made of it. Families go on dandelion picking expeditions, and pick enough for a whole week. In the Middle Ages people ate acorns and other forest fruits, particularly in times of famine.  Chestnuts  were valued, and served as the basis for many outstanding dishes. Walnuts and  hazelnuts  are used in cakes and desserts. Wild strawberries,  loganberries , blackberries, bilberries were a rich source of vitamins. Mushrooms have always been popular, and Slovenians liked picking and eating them. There are many varieties. Honey was used to a considerable extent.  Medenjaki ,  which come in different shapes are honey cakes, which are most commonly heart-shaped and are often used as gifts.
