 Kashmiri cuisine is the cuisine of the Kashmir Valley in Jammu and Kashmir, India. Kashmiris have developed the art of cooking to a very high degree of sophistication and evolved a cuisine quite distinct from that of any part of the world.[3] Rice is their staple food and has been so since ancient times.[4] The equivalent for the phrase bread and butter in Kashmiri is haakh-batta (greens and rice).[5] Meat along with rice, some vegetables and salad are prepared on special occasions like Eid.[6] A typical everyday Kashmiri meal — lunch and dinner — consists of a generous serving of rice (about 250 gms), mutton (100 gms) and vegetables (about 100gms, mostly greens) cooked in oil, and yoghurt (50 to 250 gms).[5]
 Kashmiris consume meat voraciously.[7] Kashmiri cuisine is of two distinct types — wazwan is the food of the Muslims, and the Pandits have their traditional batta.[8] They share a love for lamb; the love a Kashmiri has for meat is unparalleled.[9][8] They are, per capita, the highest mutton consumers in the subcontinent.[9] According to official data, around 2.2 million sheep are slaughtered in Kashmir every year on an average adding up to 21,000 tonnes annual meat consumption in the region.[10] Despite being Brahmin, most Kashmiri Pandits are meat eaters.[11] The amount of mutton that is required to be bought for a Kashmiri Pandit wedding feast is 650 gm per head (not considering chicken).[12] Kashmiri Muslims prefer goat, especially young, while Kashmiri Pandits choose lamb.[13] Meat is called Neni by Pandits and Maaz by Muslims in Kashmir.[14] In a majority of Kashmiri Pandit and Muslim cooking, bread is not part of the meal; it's always rice at lunch or dinner.[15] Bread is only eaten with tea in the morning or evening.[15]
 The main daily staple food of the Muslims of Kashmir is plain cooked rice. They are typically not vegetarian, with very few exceptions. Meat stock is a salient ingredient even for so-called 'vegetarian' dishes.[16] A joke shared is: Find me a Kashmiri vegetarian and I will give you a pot of gold. [16] However they often eat vegetable curries, with meat being an expensive indulgence.[14] The cooking methods of vegetables, mutton, homemade cheese (paneer), and legumes are somewhat similar to those of Kashmiri Pandits, except in the use of onions, garlic and shallots by Muslims in place of asafoetida.[14]
 In Muslim cuisine, spices are less used as compared to that in Pandit dishes. Cockscomb flower, called "moaval" in Kashmiri, is boiled to prepare a red food colouring, as used in certain dishes. Pandits use the mildly pungent Kashmiri red chili powder as a spice, as well as to impart colour to certain dishes. Muslims use chilies in moderate quantity, and avoid hot dishes at large meals.[14]
 There is also a notable difference in the mode of service and eating between Pandits and Muslims, especially in the case of feasts. Amongst Muslims usually four persons eat together, in one big tinned copper platter, called a "traem" in Kashmiri; this is a round vessel of around 45 centimetres (18 in) diameter, typically beautifully embossed.
 From the mythical Mahabharata to the Iranian invasion of Kashmir (which was a part of Gandhara) by Darius in 516 BC,[17] to the Mauryans who established Srinagara to the Gupta Empire to the invasion of Kashmir by Timur in 1398,[18][19] the culture and cuisine of Kashmiris are linked to the greater Indian, Persian and Central Asian[20] cuisines mixed with local innovations and availabilities of ingredients.[21] The term kabab is Arabic in origin, korma has Turkish roots, and rogan josh, yakhaen, ab gosht, rista and goshtaba stem from Persian sources.[22]
 The process of Kashmir's amalgamation with outer world commenced with the importation of primitive forms of snake and fire worship from Iran.[23] Since Paleolithic times, serpents were worshipped and buried with a supply of insects in their graves as a provision for their future life.[23] In addition, they splashed grains at shrines and graves to express regard unto snakes and other animals.[23]
 The range of tools recovered at the Neolithic site of Burzahom, in the district of Srinagar shows the men were skilled hunters with knowledge of implements for cultivation.[24] Stone hearths have been found at ground levels, near the mouth of pits.[24] The Period II (Ceramic Neolithic) structures show a dish with a hollow stand and a globular pot.[24] Rectangular harvesters with a curved cutting edge have also been recovered.[24] Presence of harpoons indicates fishing.[25] The art-producing behaviour of Neolithic men is witnessed in a hunting scene, with human, a dog and a sun path diagram.[24]
 Even before the Megalithic culture that followed the Neolithic period, there is evidence of wheat, barley and lentil cultivation.[24] The presence of lentil explains that the people of Burzahom had wide contacts with Central Asia.[24]
 At the Gufkral Neolithic site 41 km southwest of Srinagar, archaeologists have confirmed settlers were engaged in wild game as well as domestication of animals.[26] The animals that were known at the time were wild sheep, wild goat, wild cattle, red deer, wolf, Himalayan Ibex and bear.[26] Roasting of food (both flesh and grain) was done only outside as no hearths or fireplaces were found inside the dwelling pits. Piercers were used for making incisions and for tearing open the flesh after the animal was killed and skinned, scrapers were used to scrape fat from the flesh.[27] In the Phase IB of Neolithic occupation, some new additions included cattle and common peas.[25] Pig (sus scrofa) and fish made their appearance in the late Neolithic period. Bones of hare (lepus), hedgehog, rodents and beaver were also recovered.[28]
 On the basis of the presence of the Emmer wheat (Triticumdicoccum) crop at Kanispur, seven kilometres east of Baramulla, contacts of Harappans with the Neolithic Kashmir has been suggested.[25] With the Aryan migration to Kashmir around the 8th century BC, the fire worship cult got embedded into the innate religio-cultural texture of Kashmir through practices such as a phallic emblem of cooked rice.[23] The local ceremony of vayuk is again near to the Iranian style of Farvadin. On a special day of the month, Kashmiri Muslims remember their dead, visit their graves and distribute loaves of rice.[23]
 Earthen thalis (pans) have been found at Semthan, north of Bijbehara from the Indo-Greek period (200 BC - 1st century AD).[29] The Kushana history tells us that right from the days of the Kushana rulers (1st century AD - 450 AD) there were contacts between Romans and Kashmir.[30] Kashmir was connected to the southern silk route via Gilgit and Yasin valley at Tashkurghan.[30] The main items of export to Rome were saffron and dolomiaea costus (kutha).[30] Dolomiaea costus was used in Rome for various purposes, among which for scenting of food and seasoning of wine.[30]
 There were military contacts between the Karkota kingdom in Kashmir and the Tang (618 AD – 907 AD) court in China.[31] When the Chinese Tang Dynasty successfully defeated the Tibetan forces and entered little Palur in October 722 AD, Kashmir was credited for providing agricultural supplies essential to sustaining the Chinese troops stationed in Gilgit valley.[31]
 Since Islam did not directly arrive from Arabia to Kashmir, it naturally carried with it mixed Iranian and Central Asian influences.[23] Hence, the rishi cult identified with Hinduism in subscribing to vegetarianism, non-injury to animals and abstaining from the use of garlic and onion in food.[23] Nund Rishi, according to a legend, subsisted on a diet of dried dandelion leaves and Lal Ded preached and practiced strict vegetarianism.[32]
 Moreover, when Yusuf Shah Chak, the last independent ruler of Kashmir signed a treaty with emperor Akbar recognising his symbolic sovereignty in 1586 one of the terms was that the mint, the saffron and game would remain under imperial control.[33]
 In 1635–36, during Shahjahan's reign, a violent conflict flared up between the Shias and Sunnis when a group of both the sections were eating mulberries at Maisuma and some were accused of using indecent words against Muhammad.[34] In 1641, unprecedented floods followed by a famine rendered the villages desolate.[34] Shahjahan sent 30,000 rupees to the subedar Tarbiyat Khan to be distributed among the destitute in Srinagar and also ordered that five centres should be opened in the valley to provide free food to the needy.[34]
 Foods mentioned in ancient Kashmiri scriptures/chronicles/travellers' accounts include:[35][36][37]
 Apart from chicken, fish and game, Kashmiris use only mutton (meat of mature sheep) or goat's meat.[14] More than 75% of sheep population are cross breeds and are generally called Kashmir Merino that provides the dual purpose of meat and wool.[121] Beef is consumed in towns and villages of Kashmir more so for its affordability.[122] The biggest rabbit breeding farm in North India sprawls on six hectares of land in Wussan village of Baramulla district of Kashmir.[123] The consumption of rabbit meat as a substitute for sheep and goat meat among the general masses is becoming popular.[123] People with cardiac problems eat rabbits as the meat is considered lean and white with high nutritious value.[123]
 People in Kashmir eat different varieties of rice including the nutty and fragrant Mushk Budji, grown in the higher reaches of the Kashmir valley.[124]
 The most important and frequently used Kashmiri eatables are: haakh (collard greens or kale), monj Haak (knol khol), tsochael(mallow), bamchoont (quince), kral mound (shepherds purse), saze posh (holly hock), nadur (lotus stem), praan (shallots), aubuj (sorrel), mawal (cockscomb), wushkofur (camphor), tila gogul (mustard) and gor (water-chestnut).[125] The floating vegetable garden on the Dal Lake is the second largest wholesale market in the world.[126] Men, young and old, on their wooden boats, argue about the price of plump pumpkins and gourds as they share cigarettes or hookahs.[127] The water of Kashmir is sweeter, and that affects the taste and flavour of vegetables.[15] The items for sale include tomatoes, carrots, cucumbers, turnips, water chestnuts, leafy vegetables, and the famous nadur.[126] A porous and fibrous lake vegetable, nadur has grown to become an irreplaceable ingredient in a traditional Kashmiri kitchen.[128] Local accounts date its discovery to the 15th-century sultan Zain-ul-Abidin, who was introduced to the chewy delicacy while on a shikara ride on the Gil Sar lake located in the exteriors of Srinagar.[128] Also, according to a popular legend, the yarn threads that Lalla Ded (1320-1392), the Kashmiri mystic saint wove were thrown into the Dal Lake when her tyrant mother-in-law ridiculed and taunted her for yarning it too thin. These got changed into the fibres of nadur for eternity.[129]
 Sun-dried vegetables, locally known as hokh syun are consumed as fresh produce dwindles.[130] During summer, vegetables are peeled, chopped, salted and sun-dried to preserve them for winter.[130] The various varieties of hokh syun include dried tomatoes (ruwangun haech), dried bottle gourd (al haech), dried turnip slices (gogji haech), dried quince (bamchount haech) and dried spinach (hoech palak).[130] In the Charar Sharief area of central Kashmir, dried pears, locally known as tang haech are considered a delicacy.[130]
 Snow Mountain garlic, also known as Kashmiri garlic, is a rare single-clove variety of Allium sativum. The clove beneath is bright white to creamy-white color and offers a strong, pungent garlic flavour without the acidity present in other varieties.[131]
 Delicate nectar of the acacia flowers makes for honey in Tral, Verinag and other locations.[132]
 Kashmiri apple is famous for its juiciness and distinct flavour as well.[133] In 2019 alone, Kashmir produced over 1.9 million metric tonnes of apples, the highest among Indian states.[133] Further, Kashmir accounts for 90% of India's walnut production.[134] Kashmiri walnuts are a great source of nutrients and widely in demand across the globe.[134] Many years ago, walnut oil used to be a medium of cooking and imparted a sweeter and nuttier flavour to dishes.[135]
 Muhammad Quli Afshar brought cherries from Kabul and planted them during Akbar's time.[45] Mishri variety of cherry is famous in Kashmir and sweeter than other varieties.[136] They are loaded with minerals, vitamins and plant compounds.[136] The exotic berries from Kashmir are sweet and sour mulberry (tuell and shah-tuell), raspberry (chhanchh), barberry (kaawducchh) and red berry (haapat maewaa).[137] Gassu area on the Srinagar outskirts is known for strawberry (istaber) harvesting.[138]
 A traditionally ripened Himalayan cheese is called the milk chapati or maish krej in Kashmiri.[139]
 Kashmiri saffron is known for its aroma, colour, and medicinal value.[140] The saffron of Pampore town is considered to be of superior quality with 8.72% crocin content as compared to the Iranian variety which contains 6.82%.[140] In May 2020, Kashmiri saffron was given a geographical indication tag.[140] The spice shahi zeera or imperial cumin or black cumin belongs to Apiaceae (parsley) family and was initially available in the jungles of Gurez Valley.[141] These darker seeds unlike the regular brown zeera are of superior quality because of their smell, relative rarity and shape.[141]
 Among the spices used:
 Rock salt consumption is quite old in Kashmir.[151] It was and is still being imported from Khewrah area of Pakistani Punjab, where it was first discovered by the troops of Alexander the Great in 326 B.C.[151] Pre-independence, rock salt was imported via Mughal Road, which, before the advent of Mughals, was called Namak Route.[151] After partition, its supply was barred.[151] Because of its benefits, it is now being consumed by almost one-fourth of the population.[151]
 Spring is often considered a season of rejuvenation after a long and harsh winter.[152] Picnics, of which the Kashmiris are very fond, are planned around the theme of food.[3] The countryside is awash with white and pink flowers of almond (badaam), peach (tsunun) and cherry (gilaas) blossoms.[153] The mustard fields join the show with their bright-yellow blooms.[153] The pear (tang) blossoms can be identified by their thick cluster of flowers.[153] Apricot (Tser) blossoms are white in colour, often tinged with a pink or reddish hue.[153] They grow from late spring through early summer.[152] Beans are a spring vegetable.[152] Cherries are a fruit of late spring and summer.[152] Coriander (Danival) is a cool herb whose season predominates between spring and summer in cooler areas.[152] Garlic (Rohan) is found mainly in spring and through fall season.[152] Melons (Kharbooz) are a fruit grown in spring and summer.[152] Tender spring-time haakh (collard greens) are called kaanul.[154]
 The season of harvesting lotus stem (nadur) starts in September.[155] With the onset of autumn the markets are filled with the dried vegetables (hokh syun).[156] Rice harvest begins setting off the harud (autumn) spirit.[156] Going to the countryside, one can see paddy being cut with sickles and then stacked in huge piles to dry.[157] Chestnuts are roasted in the dying embers.[158] Saffron fields in full bloom greet you in Pampore, a part of Pulwama district.[157] Going towards the hilly areas one can see the maize and walnut trees with their fruit getting ready to be harvested.[157] Going towards the apple producing areas of Sopore in North Kashmir or Shopian in South Kashmir, one can see cartons of apple being transported to various parts of the country.[157]
 During the long winters the days are short, sunlight and electricity in short supply, so there is not much that can liven up existence except interesting food, so it constitutes a major interest of the Kashmiris' lives.[3] When all village roads remained blocked due to heavy snowfall and villagers have to use oil lamps or kerosene lanterns, the entire family is called to the kitchen where flavour of the overnight shab deg fills the entire space.[159] Winter food of Kashmir includes all sorts of pulses: razmah, mong, masoor, channa and warimuth.[156] Kohlrabi (monje) is cold tolerant, and continues to grow on the fields in winter, so much that a little frost even helps it.[160]
 Some noted Kashmiri dishes include:
 One version of the origin of kababs is the one in which Turkish soldiers were first known to grill chunks of meat on open fires.[161] Kashmir's kababs are cooked with local spices and accompanied with dips:[161]
 For the average Kashmiri, breakfast normally means fresh bread from the local bakery and a cup of noon chai (salt tea).[182] Some affordable luxuries include:
 Unlike most dishes of the Indian subcontinent where the flavour is added to the food while cooking on the flames, the wazwan flavours are added while the dish is still uncooked by adding flavoured water to the preparation or soaking in flavoured water (osmosis):[189]
 Soups are often given to new mothers:
 The wazas are trained for years to learn the art of making the right cuts and grounding the meat to perfection.[247] Traditionally, the lamb is mashed with walnut wood:[135]
 Grown in the foothills of the Himalayas, Gucchi mushrooms (kanaguchhi) are the costliest among fungi in the world.[308] They grow in clusters on logs of decaying wood in Kashmir:[308]
 Called the shadowy underbelly of the Kashmiri wazwan,[319] they add real colour to the dishes:[319]
 Kashmir is full of fresh water lakes and rivers:[336]
 Kashmiris eat a lot more rice than the people of the Jammu region:[351]
 In certain rural areas, the tradition of putting an egg or two in kanger (fire pot) is known to each individual.[368] The fragrance of an egg cooking in the kanger would trigger the enzymes signaling the egg is ready:[368]
 Going by estimates, on an average 50-60 birds are killed every day in wetlands across Kashmir:[377] Hunted game (shikaar) is not generally cooked immediately.[378] It has to be hung for some days (faisander) before dressing it for cooking. Hanging makes the meat suppler and less fibrous, making it tastier to eat.[378] Game dishes are:
 Kashmiri Pandits who were vegetarian and did not even eat onions and tomatoes were known as Dal Battas (Dal Pandits):[384]
 Kashmiri is one of the tangiest cuisines of the world.[393] Pickling has an important role in the food history of Kashmir that used to remain cut off because of harsh winters:[393]
 The nomadic shepherds of the Kashmir valley, Gujjars and Bakerwals move their herd of dairy cattle and their own settlements up and down the mountains based on changing seasons:[409]
 Before 1918, Abdul Ahad Bhat, of Ahdoos, was under the tutelage of English bakers at Nedou's, a hotel in Srinagar owned by Austro-Swiss Michael Nedou.[426] He quickly picked up the art of baking, and started a small bakery, the first by a Kashmiri at that time.[426] Ahdoos's forte was English goodies, and as India inched towards freedom from British Rule he added Kashmiri items to the menu.[426] Mughal Darbar was established on Residency Road in 1984 and on the road parallel is Jee Enn, founded by Ghulam Nabi Sofi in 1972.[426] Many of the owners and staff of these new bakeries have trained in Ahdoos.[426] The variety of pastries include:
 The Kashmir Valley is noted for its bakery tradition, that of the Qandarwan. Nowhere else in the Indian subcontinent can be found such a huge variety of leavened breads, another pointer to the Central Asian influence on Kashmiris' food habits.[5] On the Dal Lake in Kashmir or in downtown Srinagar, bakery shops are elaborately laid out. Bakers sell various kinds of breads with golden brown crusts topped with sesame and poppy seeds. Tsot and tsochvor are small round breads topped with poppy and sesame seeds, which are crisp and flaky, sheermal, baqerkhayn (puff pastry), lavas (unleavened bread) and kulcha are also popular. Girdas and lavas are served with butter.
 Kashmiri bakerkhani has a special place in Kashmiri cuisine. It is similar to a round naan in appearance, but crisp and layered, and sprinkled with sesame seeds.[430] It is typically consumed hot during breakfast.[431]
 Wazwan (Kashmiri pronunciation: [waːzɨwaːn]) is a multi-course meal in Kashmiri cuisine, originating from Kashmir.
 Kashmiris are heavy tea drinkers. Kashmiris don't use the word "Kashmiri Chai". The word "Noon" in Kashmiri means salt. The most popular drink is a pinkish colored salted tea called "noon chai."[433] It is made with black tea, milk, salt and bicarbonate of soda. The particular color of the tea is a result of its unique method of preparation and the addition of soda. The Kashmiri Hindus more commonly refer to this chai as "Sheer Chai." The Kashmiri Muslims refer to it as "Noon Chai" or "Namkeen Chai", both meaning salty tea.
 Noon Chai or Sheer Chai is a common breakfast tea in Kashmiri households and is taken with breads like baqerkhani brought fresh from Qandur (Kashmiri : کاندر ) or bakers. It is one of the most basic and essential food items in a Kashmiri household. Tea was as served in large samavars. Now, the use of Samavars is limited to special occasions and normally kettles are used.
 Nuts like almonds and pistachios and edible rose petals can also be added before serving and sometimes malai or fresh cream is added to give the tea viscosity and richness.[434]
 In Kashmir, chai is essentially salty pink tea.[435] Anything else is called Lipton chai because Lipton was the first brand of tea that came along selling chai.[435]
 At marriage feasts, festivals, and religious places, it is customary to serve kahwah – a green tea made with saffron, spices, and almonds or walnuts. Over 20 varieties of Kahwah are prepared in different households. Some people also put milk in kahwah (half milk and half kahwah). This chai is also known as "Maugal Chai" by some Kashmiri Hindus from the smaller villages of Kashmir. Kashmiri Muslims and Kashmiri Hindus from the cities of Kashmir refer to it as Kahwah or Qahwah.
 From one of the oldest and purest spring waters of Kashmir, the Kokernag Spring, Bringi Spring Water has high alkalinity and is well balanced with minerals.[436]
 The Babribyol sharbat is a concoction of sweetened milk, rose water or Rooh Afza syrup, and soaked sweet basil seeds that are grown locally.[437]
 Made from yoghurt or kefir, Kashmiri lassi (lyaess) is a liquid, salty way to drink up yoghurt.[438] The process of churning the buttermilk with a wooden choomph or churner is rhythmic and there is an art involved.[438] The yoghurt has to be churned the right way, the buttery fats have to float to the top in a nice froth, the spices and dried mint leaves have to be just right.[438]
 This fermented rice water drink is supposed to be very good for a sluggish liver.[439]
 Made by extracting the juice of different berries, it is prepared at home during Ramadan.[440] It features in 1977 Kashmiri film Arnimaal where guests are sipping on the beverage during wedding festivities.[440]
 The traditional Kashmiri wazwan, which comprises slow-cooked meat dishes is a wonderful pairing that enhances the spicy notes of whisky.[441] The Loire Valley wine Sancerre goes well with Kashmiri goshtabeh.[442] A ripe fruity red works well with the full bodied roghan josh.[443] A recommended wine to try with is Montepulciano.[444]
 While on fast, Muslims avoid consuming food during the day, while at dusk, they indulge in extra-special, bountiful meals prepared during the day.[445] The menu for Ramadan month includes khajur ka laddoo (date balls), babribyol (basil seeds), kulfi, phirin, seemni, fruit chaat, fruit custard, kateer (a drink loaded with health benefits) and noon chai.[445] The smell of slow-cooked mutton hovers, fragrant and sultry in the air, and despite the familiar air of unpredictability in Srinagar, spirits are high and streets are filled with happy greetings of Eid Mubarak.[163]
 As the festival draws to a close, most well-to-do families start placing orders with the wazas for the feast, which is cooked by chefs at their own places and then sold to the customers for serving at their homes.[446] Sacrificial animals include Delhi Walla, Merino Cross, Bakerwal and Kashmiri varieties of sheep.[447]
 Only vegetarian food is supplied to devotees.[448] Majority of people in Batmaloo and adjoining areas turn vegetarian and do not eat meat or chicken.[448] They widely consume dried turnips (gogji aare) because it is believed, during Dawood's time, sundried turnips helped Kashmir survive a famine.[449]
 The people of Pampore cook dried vegetables, eggs, cheese and other food stuff except meat and invite their relatives, friends on lunch or dinner to keep the tradition of the saint alive.
 In Khanyar and Sarai Bala areas of Srinagar, the devotees are seen outside the shrines where local and non-local business establishments install their carts and are seen selling the Kashmiri traditional food stuff. Pious men sing hearty hymns over offerings of dates and sweets.[450]
 People in Anantnag district in southern Kashmir quit eating meat as a mark of respect for the 16th century mystic.[451] Rarely is a butcher shop open during these seven days.[451] For three-and-a-half days each before and after the saint's Urs, people eat radish braised in tamarind.[452]
 The first ten days of Muharram, that mark the tragedy of Karbala, the milk-based rice pudding mayir is prepared.[358] Throughout the 10th day, Ashoora, kahwa is served to guests and mayir and sharbat distributed to mourners on the street.[358]
 For Kashmiri Pandits, the prasad offering at Shivratri puja is a charger piled high with rice, cooked lamb and fish, and a luscious raw fish in its entirety atop the pile.[453]
 Celebrated on the amavasya or the last day of the dark fortnight of Pausha(December–January), Khets Mavas or Yakshamavasya is an important festival of Kashmiri Pandits.[454] A mutton khichdi with fresh mutton marinated in a bit of curd is offered as sacrificial food.[454]
 On the 9th day of the month of ashad, Pandits in Kashmir offer the deity Sharika yellow rice cooked with turmeric, a little oil and salt along with tsarvan (goat's liver).[12]
 Tibetan exiles in Kashmir, including members of Tibet's small Muslim population live in Srinagar, mainly in a small area near the 18th-century Hari Parbat fort.[455] Popular momo (beef dumplings) shops and Tibetan restaurants are run by their children.[455] Tibetan options include Cantonese chicken and kumloo wonton, fried pasta stuffed with minced mushrooms.[455]
 Kashmiri Sikh cuisine has a bit of influence from Punjab with onions and tomatoes, but the flavouring goes the Kashmiri way with elements such as badyaan(saunf).[456] A large number of Indian tourists depend entirely on Vaishno Dhabas, the Valley's generic non-A/C restaurants that serve all-vegetarian North Indian fare.[457]
 Kashmiri recipes are meant to be passed down through teaching, from mother to daughter in cramped kitchens, standing together over pots of sputtering oil.[458]
 The leaves of Kashmiri haakh are braised in lots of water.[459] It is very important to ensure that the haakh stays submerged underwater during the initial cooking process using a wooden spatula or large spoon to continuously push the greens down.[459] Mustard oil, which is used extensively in Kashmiri cuisine, imparts an extra flavour to the dish.[459]
 The main skill of a wazwan lies in the preparation of a stock made of onions and shallots.[14]
 Whole spices must be fried in oil – clove, cardamom, cinnamon, bay leaves.[458] Fried too little, and the dish will be lifeless, without fragrance.[458] A second too much, and one will be left with nothing but bitterness.[458]
 Sliced onions are fried until golden brown and pureed with minimal water.[460]
 The yoghurt must be fatty, thick.[458] Dried mint, just a pinch, is added right at the end to freshen the dish.[458]
 The food gets its flavours and textures from the spices being slow cooked with ingredients until they let out their inherent juices and fats and melt together.[461]
 The cooking vessel in the shab deg is sealed with dough before being cooked over a simmering fire through the long winter night.[462]
 Goshtabeh and rista, the two meatball dishes are rarely found outside the valley because their unique texture is enormously challenging.[461] The sheep has to be freshly slaughtered and the meat pounded before rigor mortis sets.[461]
 The quality of pots is important, according to wosta (ustad) or chef Nazir Ahmed Aram.[16] He says they must have the right content of copper. Using wood (walnut and apple are the best) is important too. Cooking on gas is not the same.
 The special equipment used to cook Kashmiri food are:
 On normal days the cooking in both Hindu and Muslim homes is mostly done on a dan, which is an oblong clay oven about 3 ft by 2 ft in length and a foot and a half in height.[463]
 These are large brass plates used for serving food.[463]
 Among Kashmiri Pandits, most dishes are cooked in pots of baked clay. Pots used in Kashmir are round-bottomed.[463]
 These are a portable washbasin and a pitcher that are passed around to wash hands during big banquets.[463]
 These are a flat coarse stone and a wooden mallet made of walnut wood used for pounding meat to a fine texture.[463]
 These are different kinds of wooden spoons and ladles used for turning the food in clay pots so that the base does not get scraped.[463]
 This is a stone mortar with a wooden pestle used for grinding chutneys and pastes.[463]
 This jug-shaped metallic pitcher has a long tube inside that is filled with charcoal, which keeps the tea in the pot brewing.[463]
 Much like Kashmir, its people, and its narrative traditions, Kashmiri cuisine too is an amalgam of influences from Central Asia, Persia, China, and the Indian subcontinent.[464] Food recipes passed down from one culture to another are:
 Kashmiris are gregarious and like to share.[3] Language and Food are the two vital parts of the region's identity.[510] 'One who eats properly shall rule the country' it is said.[511] An interesting wedding tradition from Kashmir involves newlyweds making roti together. While the bride flattens the dough and puts it on the griddle, the groom is responsible for flipping it and making sure it is cooked.[512] Kashmiris are very particular about the taste of dishes.[189] Food connoisseurs can easily taste a single morsel and name the waza who cooked it.[189] When filmmaker Vivek Agnihotri wrote a presumptuous tweet proposing the idea of vegetarian wazwan, social media erupted in spontaneous protest.[457]
 In Kashmir, it is said that food should both taste and look good.[14] Its aroma must be appetizing. Success of a meal lies in its appeal to the eyes, nose and then the tongue. Any event, from a minor one such as receiving a guest in one's home, to a major one such as a circumcision or a wedding, becomes a celebration of preparing, laying out, serving and consuming together the most delicious victuals.[513] Delicacies are passed on to neighbours to be relished and there is no shame in asking for something when the nostrils are tickled and tempted by the mouth-watering smells from a neighbour's kitchen.[3]
 Giant dastarkhaans (white sheets) are spread on the floor on which the meal is served.[513] However humble or lofty the fare on it, the dastarkhaan has always been the center of warm hospitality and conviviality.[513] In big Kashmiri dinners, a hundred to five hundred people are usually invited.[14] Since insurgency and the resultant violence and bloodshed, food has come to hold even greater meaning as each meal signifies a celebration of life itself.[513] It is worth mentioning that wazas (the descendents of Samarkandi cooks), whose shops are located in particular areas of the city of Srinagar, form a significant political group in Kashmir.[513]
 All dishes are eaten by hand as Kashmiris believe in an intimate relationship with food.[189] Even spiritual and religious old biddies feel no qualms in chomping on ear cartilage or marrow bones long after the meal is done, pulverising everything into a heap on the thali.[453] No one bats an eyelid.[453] Kashmiris consider it disrespectful if one refuses food varieties or an extra helping.[189] They can go great lengths to persuade, swearing to die if you refuse an extra serving![189]
 Kashmiri language is abundantly rich in proverbs, witty sayings and idiomatic word-combinations.[514] The proverbs on food themes and situations are:

 Wazas play a key role in Kashmiri society for no celebration of any kind is complete without a banquet.[544] The waza along with his skilled team is hired weeks or months before the occasion.[545] There's a hierarchy among the team of wazas.[544] Given the importance of meat, the crucial task of carving the mutton goes to the head waza, at the other end of the scale, the junior most helper will do chores like pounding dried red chillies with a dash of water.[544]
 Meat is an important part of Kashmiri culture, a part of their history.[546] Kashmiris relish their delicacies without apology.[546] Meat of different parts is sold at the same price in Kashmir, unlike in western countries.[547] Cutting, dressing and carving of meat is, so to say, an art.[547] Puj in Kashmiri language means a butcher, pujwan is a butcher shop. Use of suitable parts of the animal, cut into pieces of proper size for making different dishes, is desirable.[547]

 Kashmiri women would previously take extra mutton dishes by packing them in old newspapers or plastic bags that they would carry.[582] With time, this tradition became popular, and men soon began travelling with the remaining mutton on their traem (wazwan copper dish).[582] In Kashmir, taking leftover food into carrying bags evolved into a movement, and people also granted it social legitimacy.[582] Even the elites have joined the cause and begun providing specially made carry bags of leftover food.[582] Even the leftover rice is not wasted in marriage functions and is served to animals (dogs, cattle etc.).[583]
