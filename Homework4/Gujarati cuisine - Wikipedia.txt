 Gujarati cuisine  is the cuisine of the  Indian  state of  Gujarat .
The typical  Gujarati thali  consists of  rotli ,  dal  or  curry ,  rice , and  shaak  (a dish made up of several different combinations of vegetables and spices, which may be either spicy or sweet). The  thali  will also include preparations made from pulses or whole beans (called kathor in Gujarati) such as moong, black eyed beans etc., a snack item ( farsaan ) like dhokla, pathra, samosa, fafda,  etc. and a sweet ( mishthaan ) like mohanthal, jalebi, doodh pak etc. Gujarati cuisine varies widely in flavour and heat, depending on a family's tastes as well as the region of Gujarat to which they belong.  North Gujarat ,  Kathiawad ,  Kachchh ,  Central Gujarat  and  South Gujarat  are the five major regions of Gujarat that contribute their unique touch to Gujarati cuisine. Many Gujarati dishes are distinctively sweet, salty, and spicy commonly.
 Despite easy access to plentiful  seafood , Gujarat is primarily a vegetarian state. Many communities such as Koli Patel, Ghanchi, Muslim communities and Parsi, however, do include seafood, chicken and mutton in their diet. [1] [2] [3] 
 
 
 Staple foods [ edit ] 
 Staples include homemade  khichdi  ( rice  and  lentils  or  rice  and  mung beans ),  chaas  ( buttermilk ), and  pickles  as side.  Main dishes are based on steam cooked vegetables with different spices and  dals  that are added to a  vaghar , which is a mixture of spices heated in oil that varies depending on the main ingredients.  Salt ,  sugar ,  lemon ,  lime , and  tomatoes  are used frequently to prevent dehydration in an area where temperatures reach 50 °C (122 °F) in the shade.  It is common to add a little  sugar  or  jaggery  to some of the vegetable dishes and  dal , which enhances the slightly bland taste of the vegetables.
 
   Gujarati Thali, a variety filled traditional dish served in Gujarat 
 The cuisine changes with the seasonal availability of vegetables.  In summer, when mangoes are ripe and widely available in the market, for example,  Keri no Ras  (fresh mango pulp) is often an integral part of the meal.  The spices used also change depending on the season.   Garam masala  and its constituent spices are used less in summer.  Regular fasting, with diets limited to  milk ,  dried fruits , and  nuts , is commonplace.
 In modern times, some Gujaratis have become increasingly fond of very spicy and fried dishes.  There are many chefs who have come up with fusions of Western and Gujarati food. Gujaratis are predominantly vegetarians, [4]  even though pockets of the state consume chicken, eggs and fish.
 Flat bread prepared with  Bajra  has nutritional value similar to other foods based on flours. [5]  Common meals in villages near  Saurashtra  during the cold winters consists of thick  rotis , called "rotla" made of bajra flour (pearl millet flour) and " bhakri " made of  wheat flour , garlic  chutney ,  onion , and  chaas .
 Sweets (desserts) served as part of a  thali  are typically made from  milk ,  sugar , and  nuts . "Dry" sweets such as magas and ghooghra are typically made around celebrations, such as weddings, or at  Diwali . [ citation needed ] 
 Gujarati cuisine is also distinctive in its wide variety of  farsan  — side dishes that complement the main meal and are served alongside it.  Some  farsan  are eaten as snacks or light meals by themselves.
 Gujaratis will often refer to  dal-bhat - rotli -saak  as their everyday meal. For special occasions, this basic quartet is supplemented with additional  shaak , sweet dishes, and  farsan .  A festive Gujarati  thali  often contain over a dozen items. Dietary rules restrict the permissible combination of dishes. [ citation needed ]   For example, if  kadhi  is to be served, then a lentil preparation such as  chutti dal ,  vaal , or  mug ni dal  will also be included.  The sweet dish accompanying  kadhi  will likely be milk or yogurt–based, like  doodhpak  or  shrikhand .  However, a yogurt-based  raita  would not be served with such a meal.  Festive meals based on  dal  will typically have a wheat-based sweet dish like  lapsi  or  ladoo  as the sweet accompaniment.  Many Gujarati families make and consume  moong dal  in their diet on Wednesdays. There are established combinations of spices that some believe to facilitate digestion, that are eaten with different foods.
 In coastal Gujarat, the  Kharwa  community has developed a cuisine consisting of fresh and dried fish.  Common seafood are  pomfrets ,  khandwas ,  gedadas ,  surmai ,  prawns ,  crabs ,  lobster . and  narsinga  ( calamari ).
 Gujarati thali is sometimes seen as being "no-frills" [6]  even though it can be elaborate. India's current prime minister, Narendra Modi has often arranged Gujarati food for his special overseas guests like  Shinzo Abe [7]  or Portuguese Prime Minister  António Costa [8]  Modi himself has been said to prefer Khichdi. [9]  even when visiting overseas, [10]  something that opposing politicians sometimes mocked. [11] 
 Distinct Features 
 Gujarati cuisine varies in flavour and other aspects from region to region. One can notice that food from Surat, Kutch,  Kathiawad  and North Gujarat are the most distinct ones. Tastes also differ according to family preferences. Most popular Gujarati dishes have a sweet taste, as traditionally, sugar or jaggery is added to most Gujarati food items, like vegetables and dal. Additionally, Gujarati food is cooked in unique ways, with some dishes being stir-fried while others are steam cooked, with vegetables and spices or dal being boiled and later vaghar/chaunk (fried spices) being added to it to enhance the flavour. [12]
