   Various South Korean dishes and foods 
 South Korea  is a country in  East Asia  constituting the southern part of the  Korean Peninsula . It is bordered to the north by  North Korea , and the two countries are separated by the  Korean Demilitarized Zone . Some dishes are shared by the two Koreas.
 Historically,  Korean cuisine  has evolved through centuries of social and political change. Originating from ancient  agricultural and nomadic traditions  in southern  Manchuria  and the Korean Peninsula, it has gone through a complex interaction of the natural environment and different cultural trends. [1]   Rice dishes  and  kimchi  are  staple  Korean foods. In a traditional meal, they accompany both side dishes ( Banchan ) and main courses like  juk ,  Bulgogi  or  noodles .  Soju  liquor is the best-known traditional Korean spirit. [2]   Because of historical  American influence ,  Budae-jjigae  or Korean army stew became one of its popular dishes.

 Main article:  Street food in South Korea 
 Street food in South Korea has traditionally been seen as a part of popular culture in South Korea. Historically, street food mainly included foods such as  Eomuk ,  Bungeo-ppang  and  Tteok-bokki . Street food has been sold through many types of retail outlet, with new ones being developed over time.

 Main article:  Delivery culture in South Korea 
 Delivery Culture in South Korea started in the  Joseon era . It has since evolved into one of the most sophisticated and widely used service in the country, spanning from the 18th Century to present day. Nowadays, because of a fast-paced lifestyle and the role of technology in everyday life, people use delivery services to deliver anything from food, documents, presents, etc. at a cheap price. Although  delivery  is quite common in other parts of the world, Korean delivery is unique in a way because of the use of scooters and motorcycles to quickly transport food and services. [4]
