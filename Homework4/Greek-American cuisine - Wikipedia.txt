 Greek-American cuisine  is the cuisine of  Greek Americans  and their descendants, who have modified  Greek cuisine  under the influence of American culture and  immigration  patterns of  Greeks  to the  United States . As immigrants from various Greek areas settled in different  regions of the United States  and became "Greek Americans," they carried with them different traditions of foods and recipes that were particularly identified with their regional origins in Greece and yet infused with the characteristics of their new home locale in America. Many of these foods and recipes developed into new favorites for town peoples and then later for Americans nationwide. Greek-American cuisine is especially prominent in areas of concentrated Greek communities, such as  Astoria, Queens  and  Tarpon Springs, Florida .
 
 
 Greek-American taverna [ edit ] 
   Saganaki , lit on fire, served in  Chicago 
 The  taverna  and  estiatorio  are widespread in the major US cities, serving Greek-American cooking. [1] [2]  A typical menu for a taverna would usually include many if not all of the following items:
 
 Bread , usually loaf bread, sometimes  flat bread , used to make sandwiches such as the  gyro ; 
 Salads , such as  Greek salad ; 
 Appetizers or entrées like  tzatziki  (yogurt, garlic, cucumber dip),  melitzanosalata  (eggplant dip),  tirokafteri  (whipped  feta  cheese, with hot peppers and  olive oil  dip),  spanakopita  and  dolmades  or dolmadakia – (rice mixture with fresh herbs such as mint and parsley and sometimes pine nuts-and in some regions minced meat is added-tightly wrapped with tender grape leaves and served with a thick and creamy, lemony sauce) 
 Soups like fasolada ( bean  soup) 
 Pasta such as  spaghetti  napolitano;  pastitsio  baked layers of thick pasta (Greek pastitsio noodles) and minced meat mixture topped with a thick béchamel sauce) 
 Gyro  sandwich in pita bread or plated 
 Fish and seafood dishes such as baked fresh fish, fried  salt cod  served with  skordalia  ( garlic sauce );  fried squid  and  baby octopus 
 Baked Dishes (magirefta) such as a wide variety of seasonal Vegetable dishes);  moussaka  (eggplant or zucchini, minced meat, béchamel sauce) 
 Grilled dishes such as  souvlaki 
 Wine including  retsina ,  mavrodafni  and other Greek red/white wine varieties 
 Beer 
 Spirits such as  ouzo ,  tsipouro  and  Metaxa   brandy 
 Fruit [ which? ] 
 Areas with high concentration of Greek-American restaurants [ edit ] 
   Restaurants at  Greektown, Chicago 
 Various areas of the  United States  have hosted  Greek-American  cuisine with most prominent examples being  Astoria, Queens , in New York City,  Greektown, Chicago ,  Greektown Historic District  in Detroit,  Tarpon Springs, Florida  and  Greektown, Baltimore . Greek-American cuisine spread to the western US with immigrants who tended to work mining, smelting, and railroading towns in the region. In  Salt Lake City  Greek-American cuisine is a common part of the menu at fast-food restaurants such as  Crown Burgers . [3] 
 
 Contributions [ edit ] 
 Greek Americans have contributed a lot to  American cuisine  and to many of its recipes. For example, Greek immigrants invented the  Coney Island Hot Dog . The first and most notable Coney Island Hot Dog restaurant, the American Coney Island, was founded in 1917 by Greek immigrant Constantine "Gust" Keros. Gust brought his brother over from Greece and helped him open the Lafayette Coney Island restaurant next door. [4]  Additionally, in 1949, Greek immigrant,  Nicholas Lambrinides , started  Skyline Chili , which popularized  Cincinnati chili , a culinary descendant of the Greek dish  pastitsio . [5]
