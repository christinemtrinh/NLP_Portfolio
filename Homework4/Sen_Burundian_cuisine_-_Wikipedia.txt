Burundi is situated in East Africa and has a territory full of mountains, savannas and agricultural fields, with forests in the surrounding rivers and waters.
Agriculture is spread on 80% of the country's surface and it mainly includes coffee, tea, maize, beans and manioc.
Due to these characteristics, Burundi cuisine is very representative of the African culinary culture, as it includes beans, which are the staple of Burundi cooking, exotic fruits (mainly bananas), plantains, sweet potatoes, cassava, peas, maize and cereals, like corn and wheat.

Food security remains a major problem in Burundi.
