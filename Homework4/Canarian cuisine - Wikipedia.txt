 Canarian cuisine  refers to the typical dishes and ingredients in the cuisine of the  Canary Islands , and it constitutes an important element in the culture of its inhabitants. Its main features are the freshness, variety, simplicity, and richness of its ingredients (which may be a result of the long geographical isolation the islands suffered), the mix of seafood and meat dishes, its cultural influences and the low knowledge of it by the rest of the world. Canarian cuisine is influenced by other cultures, especially that of the  aboriginal inhabitants  of the islands ( Guanches ), and has influenced Latin American cuisine (after the 20th century Canarian migration to Latin America).

 Sauces and appetizers [ edit ] 
   Papas arrugadas  with  mojo . 
 Many small dishes are presented in the Canary Islands as appetizers, or snacks ( tapas ), which are known locally as  enyesques .
 Mojo  (pronounced mO-ho) is a sauce served with many dishes, which is made mainly of oil, garlic, vinegar, salt, red pepper, thyme,  cumin ,  coriander  and several other spices. The two main kinds are  mojo rojo  (red, often served with meat) and  mojo verde  (green, often served with fish), though both can be served with potatoes. The spicy red type is called  mojo picón . This recipe is the base of the  mojos  of  Latin America , especially  Cuba ,  Dominican Republic ,  Puerto Rico , and  Venezuela , due to heavy  Canarian  emigration, and have also influenced the cuisines of the non-Hispanic Caribbean islands.
 Papas arrugadas  (literally, "wrinkly potatoes", as a reference to the look of their cooked skin) are small unskinned  potatoes  which have been boiled in  salt water  and served with  mojo .
 One very typical  Canarian  product is  gofio , a flour created by grinding roasted sweetcorn, which used to be the staple food for the local population for centuries. [1]   Gofio  is produced locally and is added to many foods. For instance, it can be mixed with warm milk to be drunk in the morning, as well as made into a dough-like food called  pella  that can be eaten alongside meals.  Gofio  can also be stirred with fish broth and onions to create a dish called  gofio escaldado  or  escaldón de gofio. 
 Local varieties of  cheese  are popular and numerous, specially  goat cheese . Cheeses from both  La Palma  and  Fuerteventura  are protected by the  Denominación de Origen  label. Other notable cheeses are the  Flor de Guía cheese  and the  queso tierno  (tender cheese). Hard cheese is made into a paste called  Almogrote  on  La Gomera  island. Grilled cheese with  mojo  is sometimes served as a starter.
 
 First courses [ edit ] 
 Traditional Canarian meals usually start with soup, in order to prepare the stomach for the meal. Among the best-known soups are:
 
 Potaje  [ es ]  is a kind of chunky vegetable soup with potatoes, one of the main ways Canarian people consume vegetables. Ingredients can vary largely, depending on the island. One of the most popular is the  potage de berros  (watercress soup). They can be machine-blended into purees, more suitable for children. 
 Caldo de papas  (potato soup) is a humble soup made mainly of potatoes and coriander. 
 Caldo de pescado  (fish soup) usually features popular fish of the islands, like the  mero  ( grouper ),  sama  ( common dentex ) and  cherne  ( wreckfish ). 
 Rancho canario  is a soup with chickpeas, lard, thick noodles, potatoes and meat. 
 Fish [ edit ]

 Waters around the Canary Islands are rich with a great variety of  autochthonous  fish. These can be prepared in many ways, including oven-roasted (sometimes covered in a salt bed), fried, and marinated in various sauces. Some preparations include:
 
 Sancocho canario  [ es ] , boiled fish with potatoes, sweet potatoes,  gofio  and  mojo . In Tenerife, it is served in a pot. 
 Pescado seco  [ es ]  (dry fish), which can include  tollos  ( school shark  strips served with sauce) and  jareas  (open and dried fish, similar to  bacalhau , that are often eaten roasted). 
 Meats [ edit ] 
 The most widely consumed meats are  pork ,  chicken ,  rabbit  and  goat .
 
 Puchero canario  [ es ]  is a meat-rich soup which is the Canarian equivalent to Spanish  cocidos . Chicken, beef and pork meat are combined with chickpeas, corn cobs, sweet potatoes, potatoes and other vegetables (such as carrot and cabbage). 
 Goat meat  has been eaten in the islands since pre-Spanish times. 
 Ropa vieja  (literally, 'old clothes') is a dish consisting of chicken and beef mixed with potatoes and garbanzos ( chickpeas ). Canarian  ropa vieja  is the father of  Cuban   ropa vieja  through Canarian  emigration . 
 Conejo en salmorejo  is a traditional rabbit stew [2]  marinated in coriander sauce (not to be confused with mainland Spain's  salmorejo ). 
 Pork is the main ingredient of dishes such as  carne fiesta  (literally, 'party meat') and  costillas con piña  (ribs with corn cobs) [ clarification needed ] . 
 Sweets and desserts [ edit ] 
 Canarian desserts often use simple ingredients, such as cane sugar, honey,  matalahuga  or  matalauva  ( anise ), almonds and traditional    miel de palma  (especially on the island of  La Palma ). Among the desserts are  bienmesabe  (literally, a contraction of the Spanish phrase that means 'tastes good to me'), which is a paste of almonds, honey and sugar often served with ice cream or cream and  cat's tongue cookies . [3]   Frangollo  is a mix of corn flour, sugar, almonds and raisins, while  truchas  are pastries (filled with sweet potato paste or  cabell d'angel , for instance) that are prepared at Christmastime.
 In  El Hierro  there is a cake named  quesadilla  which is made with cheese. Other specialities include  rosquetes  (ring-shaped fried pastries),  quesillo  (tender cheese cake),  rapaduras  (cane sugar candy),  Príncipe Alberto  (chocolate cake from La Palma) and  leche asada  (milk cake).  Gofio  is also employed in some desserts such as  huevos mole ,  pella de gofio  (milk and  gofio  patty) and  mousse de gofio  ( gofio  cream).
 Tropical fruits, especially bananas, are widely grown and consumed in the islands, even if they are not native species.
 
 Wines and liquors [ edit ] 
 The  wine  from the  malvasia grape  was a product of Canarian export since the 17th century, immediately after the decline of sugar plantations and until its commerce was blocked by the British Royal Navy in the late 18th century. Nowadays the islands produce ten protected geographical indications. Canarian  Denominación de Origen  wines are:

 Licor 43  is not made on the Canary Islands, but is an ingredient commonly used to make the  barraquito / zaperoco , a multilayered drink made of Licor 43, coffee, condensed milk and frothed milk. [4]
