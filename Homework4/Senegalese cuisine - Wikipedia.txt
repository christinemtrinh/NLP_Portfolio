 Culinary traditions of Senegal 
   Thiéboudiène boukhonk  with  tamarind 
   Poulet yassa 
   Chebu yapp , a beef version of  thiéboudienne 
   Couscous Senegalese  thièré  with chicken and sauce ( thièré / chere —same word, spellings vary) 
   Soumbala  or  dawadawa —a  fermented  African locust bean ( Parkia biglobosa ) food condiment. It is used widely throughout West Africa—much like  miso  in East Asia, it is made from the boiled seed, which is then fermented. It is sold in small balls and sometimes also in powdered form. 
 Ears of  fonio  (or  acha ). The ancient grain is protein-rich and grows well in arid conditions, and no  pesticides  are needed for its cultivation. In Senegal, where it is part of local customs and traditions,  fonio  is used in breakfast, lunch, and dinner dishes. The longtime  neglected and underutilized crop  made a renaissance with the invention of the  fonio husking machine  by  Sanoussi Diakité . (left); Dambun Acha (right). [ clarification needed ] 
 The  cuisine of  Senegal  is a  West African cuisine  influenced by  North African ,  French , and  Portuguese cuisine  and derives from the nation's many ethnic groups, the largest being the  Wolof .  Islam , which first penetrated the region in the 11th century, also plays a role in the cuisine.  Senegal  was a colony of  France  until 1960. Ever since its colonization, emigrants have brought Senegalese cuisine to many other regions.
 Because  Senegal  borders the  Atlantic Ocean ,  fish  is very important in Senegalese cooking.  Chicken ,  lamb ,  peas ,  eggs , and  beef  are also used, but  pork  is not due to the nation's largely  Muslim  population.
 Peanuts , the primary crop of Senegal, as well as  couscous ,  white rice ,  sweet potatoes ,  lentils ,  black-eyed peas  and various vegetables, are also incorporated into many recipes.
 Meats and vegetables are typically stewed or marinated in herbs and spices, and then poured over rice or couscous, or eaten with bread.
 Popular fresh juices are made from  bissap ,  ginger ,  bouye  (pronounced 'buoy', which is the fruit of the  baobab  tree, also known as "monkey bread fruit"),  mango , or other fruit or wild trees (most famously  soursop , which is called  corossol  in French).
 Desserts are very rich and sweet, combining native ingredients with the extravagance and style characteristic of the French impact on Senegal's culinary methods. They are often served with fresh fruit and are traditionally followed by  coffee  or  tea . Tea, known as  attaya , is served in a ritualistic fashion.
 
 
 Meals [ edit ] 
 Thieboudienne  or  chebu jën  (among other names)—"The Rice of Fish." Dubbed as the national dish of Senegal, it consists of flavoursome fish that has been marinated with parsley, lemon, garlic, onions (and other herbs), then later cooked with tomato paste and a variety of vegetables such as lettuce, cabbage, and carrots. Rice is later added to the mix giving it a reddish look. 
 Thiébou yapp  or  chebu yap —"The Rice of Meat." It is very popular with the Senegalese and is usually cooked with beef (or lamb) that is first fried and garnished with onions, garlic, black pepper, red pepper, and salt (and other ingredients). Mustard and water are later added to the mix for the meat to tenderize and soak up all the flavours. As with  chebu jën , rice is then added to the mix and tends to be garnished with either green olives or cooked  black-eyed peas . [ citation needed ] 
 Thiébou guinar  or  chebu ginaar —"The Rice of Chicken." The preparation and procedures are similar to that of  chebu yap : the chicken is first fried with herbs and spices, and later soaked in water and mustard. When the rice is to be added, it is usually garnished with carrots. [1] 
 Thiébou guerté  or  chebu gerte —"The Rice of Peanut." Peanuts are known to be Senegal's cash crop. It too follows the same preparations and procedures as  chebu yap  and  chebu ginaar , where the meat is first fried with herbs and spices. However, peanut butter is added to the dish, replacing mustard, which is added with water to allow the meat to soak up all the flavour. Creating a thick paste, rice is then added to the mix. This dish is not very well known and is rarely cooked by the Senegalese, but if so, only on special occasions. [ citation needed ] 
 Yassa —Now popular with other West African countries,  yassa  is chicken or fish first marinated with spices, then simmered with onion, garlic, mustard, and lemon juice. This creates a chicken and onion sauce side-dish that is served with plain white rice. 
 Chere —a  millet  couscous found in  Senegal ,  Gambia  and  Mauritania . [2] 
 Maafe —seasoned fish, chicken, lamb, or beef cooked with vegetables in a tomato and peanut butter sauce. 
 Bassi-salté — A traditional stew, [3]  seasoned meat cooked with tomato paste and vegetables over the local couscous called  chere . 
 Sombi —sweet milk-rice soup. [4] 
 Capitaine à la Saint-Louisienne —perch stuffed with spices. [5] 
 Footi —a vegetable sauce [6] 
 Ndambé [7]  or  ndambe —beans cooked in a spiced tomato paste, typically served on bread as a breakfast sandwich. 
 Fattaya —most often a street food, fried dough filled with French fries, a thick  yassa  onion sauce, a fried egg, and a bit of ketchup and hot sauce. [8] 
 Desserts [ edit ] 
 Thiakry —a couscous pudding. 
 Lakh - a pudding made with Thiakry grains and a more liquid yogurt. 
 Cinq Centimes —the Five-Cent Cookie, a peanut cookie popular in marketplaces. [9] 
 Banana glacé —a sophisticated banana soup dessert created by Mamadou, owner of Les Cannibales Deux Restaurant in  Dakar . [10] 
 Drinks [ edit ] 
 Powdered milk—which is imported—is preferred over other local milks. Curdled milk is very popular. 
 The consumption of fresh fruit juice is not very common. 
 Bissap  is the most popular beverage. It is a purplish-red juice made from hibiscus flowers, water and sugar. Fresh mint leaves and orange blossom are sometimes added. 
 Other juices are also drunk:  dakhar  (tamarind juice),  gingembre  (ginger brew),   bouye  (brew made from baobab fruit, also known as "monkey bread"). 
 Tea is also highly popular. 
 Local beers ( Gazelle  and  Flag ) are available; however, alcohol consumption is not very popular given that the majority of the population is Muslim (95%).
