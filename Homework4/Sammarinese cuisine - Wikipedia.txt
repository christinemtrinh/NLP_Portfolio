 Food in San Marino 
   A  piada  or a  piadina  with  bresaola .  Piadina s are not only Sammarinese dishes but are also common in the surrounding region,  Emilia Romagna . 
 As  San Marino  is a  microstate  completely  landlocked  by Italy,  Sammarinese cuisine  is strongly similar to  Italian cuisine , [1] [2]  especially that of the adjoining  Emilia-Romagna  and  Marche  regions. San Marino's primary agricultural products are cheese, wine and livestock, and  cheesemaking  is a primary economic activity in San Marino. [3]  San Marino participated in  The Exposition Universelle of 1889 , a  world's fair  held in  Paris , France, with three exhibits of oils and cheese. [4] 
 
 
 Dishes [ edit ] 
 Local savoury dishes include  fagioli con le cotiche , a  Christmas  bean and bacon soup;  pasta e ceci , a  chickpea  and  noodle  soup with  garlic  and  rosemary ;  nidi di rondine , a baked  pasta  dish with smoked ham, beef, cheese, and a tomato sauce; and roast rabbit with  fennel . [1] [5] [6]   Erbazzone  is a spinach-based dish that includes cheese and onions. [5]  There is a dish found mostly in  Borgo Maggiore  called a  piada , which consists of  flatbread  with various fillings and is somewhat similar to a  piadina  from Emilia-Romagna.
 
 Desserts and sweets [ edit ] 
   Bustrengo 
 Sweets include a cake known as  Torta Tre Monti  ("Cake of the Three Mountains/Towers"), based on  The Three Towers of San Marino [1] [2]  and similar to a layered wafer cake covered in  chocolate ;  Torta Titano , a layered dessert made with biscuit, hazelnuts, chocolate, cream and coffee, also inspired by San Marino's central mountain,  Monte Titano ;  Bustrengo , a traditional  Christmas cake  made with honey, nuts and dried fruit; [1] [7]   Verretta , a dessert made of hazelnuts, praline and chocolate wafers;  Cacciatello , a dessert made with milk, sugar and eggs, similar to  Crème caramel ; and  zuppa di ciliegie , cherries stewed in sweetened red wine and served on white bread. [8] 
 
 Alcoholic beverages [ edit ] 
 Wine [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Sammarinese wine 
 The region also produces a number of  wines  such as Brugneto and Tessano (cask-aged red wines) and Biancale and Roncale (still white wines). [9] [10] [11]  Wine in San Marino is regulated by the San Marino Wine Association, which is also a large-scale wine producer. [10] 
 
 Spirits [ edit ] 
 Its  liqueurs  include the  aniseed -flavoured Mistrà, the  truffle -flavoured Tilus and the herbal Tamir Shachar [12]
