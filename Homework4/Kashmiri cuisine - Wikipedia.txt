   Food portal v t e   Shufta, a Kashmiri dessert, at Matamaal, New Delhi's first Kashmiri pandit restaurant. [1]  One of the main differences between Kashmiri pandit and Kashmiri Muslim food is the use of onion and garlic. [2] 
 Kashmiri cuisine  is the cuisine of the  Kashmir Valley  in  Jammu and Kashmir , India. Kashmiris have developed the art of cooking to a very high degree of sophistication and evolved a cuisine quite distinct from that of any part of the world. [3]  Rice is their staple food and has been so since ancient times. [4]  The equivalent for the phrase bread and butter in  Kashmiri  is  haakh-batta  (greens and rice). [5]  Meat along with rice, some vegetables and salad are prepared on special occasions like  Eid . [6]  A typical everyday Kashmiri meal — lunch and dinner — consists of a generous serving of rice (about 250 gms), mutton (100 gms) and vegetables (about 100gms, mostly greens) cooked in oil, and  yoghurt  (50 to 250 gms). [5] 
 Kashmiris consume meat voraciously. [7]  Kashmiri cuisine is of two distinct types —  wazwan  is the food of the Muslims, and the Pandits have their traditional  batta . [8]  They share a love for lamb; the love a Kashmiri has for meat is unparalleled. [9] [8]  They are, per capita, the highest mutton consumers in the subcontinent. [9]  According to official data, around 2.2 million sheep are slaughtered in Kashmir every year on an average adding up to 21,000 tonnes annual meat consumption in the region. [10]  Despite being  Brahmin , most Kashmiri Pandits are meat eaters. [11]  The amount of mutton that is required to be bought for a Kashmiri Pandit wedding feast is 650 gm per head (not considering chicken). [12]  Kashmiri Muslims prefer goat, especially young, while Kashmiri Pandits choose lamb. [13]  Meat is called  Neni  by Pandits and  Maaz  by Muslims in Kashmir. [14]  In a majority of Kashmiri Pandit and Muslim cooking, bread is not part of the meal; it's always rice at lunch or dinner. [15]  Bread is only eaten with tea in the morning or evening. [15] 
 The main daily staple food of the Muslims of Kashmir is plain cooked rice. They are typically not vegetarian, with very few exceptions. Meat stock is a salient ingredient even for so-called 'vegetarian' dishes. [16]  A joke shared is:  Find me a Kashmiri vegetarian and I will give you a pot of gold.   [16]  However they often eat vegetable curries, with meat being an expensive indulgence. [14]  The cooking methods of vegetables, mutton, homemade cheese ( paneer ), and legumes are somewhat similar to those of Kashmiri Pandits, except in the use of onions, garlic and shallots by Muslims in place of  asafoetida . [14] 
 In Muslim cuisine, spices are less used as compared to that in Pandit dishes.  Cockscomb flower , called "moaval" in  Kashmiri , is boiled to prepare a red food colouring, as used in certain dishes. Pandits use the mildly pungent Kashmiri red chili powder as a spice, as well as to impart colour to certain dishes. Muslims use chilies in moderate quantity, and avoid hot dishes at large meals. [14] 
 There is also a notable difference in the mode of service and eating between Pandits and Muslims, especially in the case of feasts. Amongst  Muslims  usually four persons eat together, in one big tinned copper platter, called a "traem" in Kashmiri; this is a round vessel of around 45 centimetres (18 in) diameter, typically beautifully embossed.
 
 
 History of Kashmiri cuisine [ edit ] 
 From the mythical Mahabharata to the Iranian invasion of Kashmir (which was a part of Gandhara) by Darius in 516 BC, [17]  to the Mauryans who established Srinagara to the Gupta Empire to the invasion of Kashmir by Timur in 1398, [18] [19]  the culture and cuisine of Kashmiris are linked to the greater Indian, Persian and Central Asian [20]  cuisines mixed with local innovations and availabilities of ingredients. [21]  The term  kabab  is Arabic in origin,  korma  has Turkish roots, and  rogan josh ,  yakhaen ,  ab gosht ,  rista  and  goshtaba  stem from Persian sources. [22] 
 
 Early History [ edit ] 
 The process of Kashmir's amalgamation with outer world commenced with the importation of primitive forms of snake and fire worship from Iran. [23]  Since  Paleolithic  times, serpents were worshipped and buried with a supply of insects in their graves as a provision for their future life. [23]  In addition, they splashed grains at shrines and graves to express regard unto snakes and other animals. [23] 
 The range of tools recovered at the  Neolithic  site of  Burzahom , in the district of  Srinagar  shows the men were skilled hunters with knowledge of implements for cultivation. [24]  Stone hearths have been found at ground levels, near the mouth of pits. [24]  The Period II ( Ceramic Neolithic ) structures show a dish with a hollow stand and a globular pot. [24]  Rectangular harvesters with a curved cutting edge have also been recovered. [24]  Presence of harpoons indicates fishing. [25]  The art-producing behaviour of Neolithic men is witnessed in a hunting scene, with human, a dog and a sun path diagram. [24] 
 Even before the Megalithic culture that followed the Neolithic period, there is evidence of wheat, barley and lentil cultivation. [24]  The presence of lentil explains that the people of Burzahom had wide contacts with Central Asia. [24] 
 At the Gufkral Neolithic site 41 km southwest of Srinagar, archaeologists have confirmed settlers were engaged in wild game as well as domestication of animals. [26]  The animals that were known at the time were wild sheep, wild goat, wild cattle, red deer, wolf, Himalayan Ibex and bear. [26]  Roasting of food (both flesh and grain) was done only outside as no hearths or fireplaces were found inside the dwelling pits. Piercers were used for making incisions and for tearing open the flesh after the animal was killed and skinned, scrapers were used to scrape fat from the flesh. [27]  In the Phase IB of Neolithic occupation, some new additions included cattle and common peas. [25]  Pig ( sus scrofa ) and fish made their appearance in the late Neolithic period. Bones of hare ( lepus ), hedgehog, rodents and beaver were also recovered. [28] 
 On the basis of the presence of the Emmer wheat ( Triticumdicoccum ) crop at Kanispur, seven kilometres east of Baramulla, contacts of Harappans with the Neolithic Kashmir has been suggested. [25]  With the Aryan migration to Kashmir around the 8th century BC, the fire worship cult got embedded into the innate religio-cultural texture of Kashmir through practices such as a phallic emblem of cooked rice. [23]  The local ceremony of  vayuk  is again near to the Iranian style of  Farvadin . On a special day of the month, Kashmiri Muslims remember their dead, visit their graves and distribute loaves of rice. [23] 
 
 Indo-Greek & Kushana period [ edit ] 
 Earthen  thalis  (pans) have been found at Semthan, north of Bijbehara from the Indo-Greek period (200 BC - 1st century AD). [29]  The Kushana history tells us that right from the days of the Kushana rulers (1st century AD - 450 AD) there were contacts between Romans and Kashmir. [30]  Kashmir was connected to the southern silk route via Gilgit and Yasin valley at Tashkurghan. [30]  The main items of export to Rome were saffron and  dolomiaea costus  ( kutha ). [30]  Dolomiaea costus was used in Rome for various purposes, among which for scenting of food and seasoning of wine. [30] 
 
 Hindu dynasties [ edit ] 
 There were military contacts between the Karkota kingdom in Kashmir and the Tang (618 AD – 907 AD) court in China. [31]  When the Chinese Tang Dynasty successfully defeated the Tibetan forces and entered little Palur in October 722 AD, Kashmir was credited for providing agricultural supplies essential to sustaining the Chinese troops stationed in Gilgit valley. [31] 
 
 Kashmir Sultanate (1346 - 1580s) [ edit ] 
 Since Islam did not directly arrive from Arabia to Kashmir, it naturally carried with it mixed Iranian and Central Asian influences. [23]  Hence, the  rishi  cult identified with Hinduism in subscribing to vegetarianism, non-injury to animals and abstaining from the use of garlic and onion in food. [23]   Nund Rishi , according to a legend, subsisted on a diet of dried dandelion leaves and  Lal Ded  preached and practiced strict vegetarianism. [32] 
 Moreover, when  Yusuf Shah Chak , the last independent ruler of Kashmir signed a treaty with emperor Akbar recognising his symbolic sovereignty in 1586 one of the terms was that the mint, the saffron and game would remain under imperial control. [33] 
 
 Mughals (1580s - 1750s) [ edit ] 
 In 1635–36, during Shahjahan's reign, a violent conflict flared up between the Shias and Sunnis when a group of both the sections were eating mulberries at Maisuma and some were accused of using indecent words against Muhammad. [34]  In 1641, unprecedented floods followed by a famine rendered the villages desolate. [34]  Shahjahan sent 30,000 rupees to the  subedar  Tarbiyat Khan to be distributed among the destitute in Srinagar and also ordered that five centres should be opened in the valley to provide free food to the needy. [34] 
 
 Foods mentioned in ancient Kashmiri texts [ edit ] 
 Foods mentioned in ancient Kashmiri scriptures/chronicles/travellers' accounts include: [35] [36] [37] 
 
 Rice , which could be imported from other countries in times of famine. [38] [39]  Sultan Zain-ul-Abidin diverted the waters of the Dal Lake into the Mar canal which he extended up to Shadipur where it emptied itself at the confluence of Jhelum and Indus. [40]  Owing to these irrigation works, and reclamation of large areas for cultivation, Kashmir became self-sufficient in rice production. [40]  The natives considered the hot water at Dewsur sacred, and said that when one wished to know if any undertaking will prosper, they must take an earthen vessel, fill it with rice, and having secured the mouth, so that water may be excluded, throw it into the holy font. If on coming up the rice was boiled, it was deemed a fortunate omen, but unpropitious if otherwise. [41]

[62] [89]  Hiuen Tsang, a Chinese traveller in his  Travels in India  (631 AD) says that saffron flowers were long used to adorn the neck of oxen at the autumn festival in the country of Kashmir. [90]  Reference has been made of Kashmiri saffron in the  Ratnavali  of Harsha. [91]  Kashmiri poet  Bilhana  in his Vikramanka Charitam says that the cultivation of saffron flowers in Kashmir originated from Takshaka Naga, a holy spring. [90]  A popular myth talks about how when a naga chieftain (a water god) fell sick with an eye complaint, he was cured by the  vaidya  of Padmapur (Pampore). [90]  In gratitude, the naga gave him a bulb of saffron and thus the locals began the cultivation. [90]  Ksemendra mentioned that traders used to earn a lot through trade in saffron, in his 11th century satire  Samayamatrka . [92]  In the  Kaula  tradition, a ceremony was performed with saffron for warriors. [93]  The Persian historian Firishta (1612) mentions that the saffron of Kashmir was particularly good. [94]  At the time of Jehangir (1605–27), the annual crop was 18.5 tonnes, more than anywhere in the world. [95] 
 Clarified Butter , lamps were prepared with  ghee . [62] [96]

 Half ripe Barley . [62] 
 Bread (apupa)  and  cake (pistaka)  made from barley. [44]  A particular day of the year was observed as a festival, when barely became ripe in the fields. [44] 
 Spring Water , of Kokar Nag was said to appease hunger and renew appetite. [98]  A fountain in the neighbourhood of Achh Dal was scarcely equalled for its coldness, limpidity and refreshing qualities. [99] 
 Tea , came to Kashmir by caravans across Chinese Tartary and Tibet. [100] 
 Beer . [53]  For Kashmiri polymath  Abhinavagupta , alcohol was the external essence of Shiva. [101]  Without alcohol, there was neither enjoyment nor liberation. [101]  The use of drink is admitted during the  sautramani  sacrifice of the brahmans, during a great battle in case of warriors, during farming in case of peasants, at great family celebrations, at the birth of a son, on the occasion of marriage or gathering of friends, and at the conclusion of the cremation ritual in case of slaves. [102]  For his commentator Jayaratha, the practitioner should drink because of a sort of  bhairavic  greatness, but not like a bonded animal, because of greed. [103]  The finest drink is on every occasion, the drink of average value is at the junctures, the worst is only once a month, and beyond a month he becomes a bonded animal. [93] 
 Wheat Beer. [104] 
 Mead . [104] 
 Rum , from treacle. [104] 
 Wine , called  mas  in Kashmiri language. [45]  Kashmir was the only part of India where wine was made from the juice of the grape, a fact to be attributed rather to its acescent quality, than to any scarcity of fruit. [105]  For Abhinavagupta, alcohol which came from grape was splendour to a supreme degree. [104]  He praised the wine of his native Kashmir as  mahabhairava  (the mercurial essence). [101]  Jayaratha cautions against mixing it with any other ingredient, for the reason that its effectiveness would be quite limited. [106]  The popularity of wine in Kashmir is evident from the fact that on certain religious festivals like the new snowfall day, the second Mahimana and the Iramanjari-pujana the drinking of wine is recommended in the  Nilamata Purana . [55]  It was enjoyed equally by members of both the sexes. [55]  At the beaded ring of a statue of goddess Lakshmi in a distinctively Gandharan style discovered by Frenchman Albert Foucher near the village of Brar in Bandipora in 1896, one can see clusters and foliage of vines. [107]  One Kashmiri king was so intoxicated with wine he told his ministers that if they wished to increase the beauty of his city, they should burn  Pravarapura , the city built by king Sri Pravarasena of the  Alchon Huns  and his orders could not be disobeyed. [108]   Sikandar Butshikan , or the  destroyer of idols  (c.1416) prohibited vending wine in Kashmir. [109] 
 Maireya Wine , a spicy wine perfumed by camphor, [110]  and made out of fruits and flowers with a natural sugar base. [111] 
 Asava Wine , decocted extracts or cold infusion extracts of different herbs fermented with flowers of  dhataki  ( woodfordia fruticosa ). [112] [113] 
 New Wine . [62]  The Hindus pressed the juice of the grape, strained it, placed it in the sun for four or five days and then drank it. [114] 
 Sweet wine , like Madeira. [50]  It would be found to improve greatly in quality with age. [105] 
 Fruit wine (madapan) , made out of pears, apples or mulberry. [115] 
 Brandy , distilled from wine. [116]

 Fish . [62] 
 Dried food . [62] 
 Ira-flowers(drink) . [62]

 Ingredients and seasoning [ edit ] 
 Meat [ edit ] 
 Apart from chicken, fish and game, Kashmiris use only mutton (meat of mature sheep) or goat's meat. [14]  More than 75% of sheep population are cross breeds and are generally called Kashmir Merino that provides the dual purpose of meat and wool. [121]  Beef is consumed in towns and villages of Kashmir more so for its affordability. [122]  The biggest rabbit breeding farm in North India sprawls on six hectares of land in Wussan village of Baramulla district of Kashmir. [123]  The consumption of rabbit meat as a substitute for sheep and goat meat among the general masses is becoming popular. [123]  People with cardiac problems eat rabbits as the meat is considered lean and white with high nutritious value. [123] 
 
 Cereals [ edit ] 
 People in Kashmir eat different varieties of rice including the nutty and fragrant  Mushk Budji , grown in the higher reaches of the Kashmir valley. [124] 
 
 Vegetables [ edit ] 
 The most important and frequently used Kashmiri eatables are:  haakh  (collard greens or kale),  monj Haak  (knol khol),  tsochael (mallow),  bamchoont  (quince),  kral mound  (shepherds purse),  saze posh  (holly hock),  nadur  (lotus stem),  praan  (shallots),  aubuj  (sorrel),  mawal  (cockscomb),  wushkofur  (camphor),  tila gogul  (mustard) and  gor  (water-chestnut). [125]  The floating vegetable garden on the Dal Lake is the second largest wholesale market in the world. [126]  Men, young and old, on their wooden boats, argue about the price of plump pumpkins and gourds as they share cigarettes or hookahs. [127]  The water of Kashmir is sweeter, and that affects the taste and flavour of vegetables. [15]  The items for sale include tomatoes, carrots, cucumbers, turnips, water chestnuts, leafy vegetables, and the famous  nadur . [126]  A porous and fibrous lake vegetable,  nadur  has grown to become an irreplaceable ingredient in a traditional Kashmiri kitchen. [128]  Local accounts date its discovery to the 15th-century sultan Zain-ul-Abidin, who was introduced to the chewy delicacy while on a shikara ride on the Gil Sar lake located in the exteriors of Srinagar. [128]  Also, according to a popular legend, the yarn threads that Lalla Ded (1320-1392), the Kashmiri mystic saint wove were thrown into the Dal Lake when her tyrant mother-in-law ridiculed and taunted her for yarning it too thin. These got changed into the fibres of  nadur  for eternity. [129] 
 Sun-dried vegetables, locally known as  hokh syun  are consumed as fresh produce dwindles. [130]  During summer, vegetables are peeled, chopped, salted and sun-dried to preserve them for winter. [130]  The various varieties of  hokh syun  include dried tomatoes ( ruwangun haech ), dried bottle gourd ( al haech ), dried turnip slices ( gogji haech ), dried quince ( bamchount haech ) and dried spinach ( hoech palak ). [130]  In the Charar Sharief area of central Kashmir, dried pears, locally known as  tang haech  are considered a delicacy. [130] 
 Snow Mountain garlic , also known as Kashmiri garlic, is a rare single-clove variety of  Allium sativum . The clove beneath is bright white to creamy-white color and offers a strong, pungent garlic flavour without the acidity present in other varieties. [131] 
 
 Sugar & sweeteners [ edit ] 
 Delicate nectar of the acacia flowers makes for honey in Tral, Verinag and other locations. [132] 
 
 Fruits [ edit ] 
 Kashmiri apple is famous for its juiciness and distinct flavour as well. [133]  In 2019 alone, Kashmir produced over 1.9 million metric tonnes of apples, the highest among Indian states. [133]  Further, Kashmir accounts for 90% of India's walnut production. [134]  Kashmiri walnuts are a great source of nutrients and widely in demand across the globe. [134]  Many years ago, walnut oil used to be a medium of cooking and imparted a sweeter and nuttier flavour to dishes. [135] 
 Muhammad Quli Afshar brought cherries from Kabul and planted them during Akbar's time. [45]  Mishri variety of cherry is famous in Kashmir and sweeter than other varieties. [136]  They are loaded with minerals, vitamins and plant compounds. [136]  The exotic berries from Kashmir are sweet and sour mulberry ( tuell  and  shah-tuell ), raspberry ( chhanchh ), barberry ( kaawducchh ) and red berry ( haapat maewaa ). [137]  Gassu area on the Srinagar outskirts is known for strawberry ( istaber ) harvesting. [138] 
 
 Dairy Products [ edit ] 
 A traditionally ripened Himalayan cheese is called the milk chapati or  maish krej  in Kashmiri. [139] 
 
 Spices [ edit ] 
 Kashmiri saffron is known for its aroma, colour, and medicinal value. [140]  The saffron of Pampore town is considered to be of superior quality with 8.72% crocin content as compared to the Iranian variety which contains 6.82%. [140]  In May 2020, Kashmiri saffron was given a geographical indication tag. [140]  The spice  shahi zeera  or imperial cumin or black cumin belongs to Apiaceae (parsley) family and was initially available in the jungles of Gurez Valley. [141]  These darker seeds unlike the regular brown  zeera  are of superior quality because of their smell, relative rarity and shape. [141] 
 Among the spices used:
 
 Kashmiri  chilli pepper  ( martswangun ) — chilies are grown locally in Kashmir. [142]  When they turn red, they are dried and ground into powder form. [142]  Powdered red chilies are moderately hot coloring agents that are used for most meat and some vegetarian dishes. [142] 
 asafoetida  ( yangu ) — used in much of Kashmiri Pandit cuisine, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian. [143] 
 cardamom  ( nich auleh ) — the seeds, derived after crushing the pods, can be used in curries such as  yakhean ,  qaliya , and also in teas such as  kahwah  and  sheer/noon chai . [144] 
 bay leaf ( tej pata ) — most commonly used for rice  polav  and biryani dishes in Kashmir. [145] 
 black pepper ( marts ) — both fruit and seed are used. [145] 
 cinnamon ( dalcyn ) — typically used in most of the dishes in Kashmir and is also an important ingredient in  kahwah  chai. [144] 
 cloves ( rong ) — an essential ingredient in many dishes such as  rogan josh ,  dum olav  and is also used in making pickles. [146] 
 fennel ( bodiyana ) — often used in making breads such as  kulcha  and is served by itself after food. [143]  Ground aniseed is used in almost all Kashmiri stews. [143] 
 ginger ( shaunth ) — in its dried, powdered form, it is used in almost all Kashmiri cuisine. [147] 
 tamarind ( tambar ) 
 turmeric powder ( lader ) — among the most widely used spice in Indian cooking and in Kashmiri cuisine in particular. [148]  It imparts a yellow color to curries but should never be substituted for saffron for this purpose because the two have little in common. [148] 
 saffron ( kong posh ) — a pinch of the crumpled stigmas is enough to give the color and bittersweet taste to a dish. [147] 
 cumin seeds ( safed ziur ) [14]  — an important spice for almost all dishes, vegetarian or non-vegetarian, except  bhat haakh . [146] 
 caraway seeds ( krihun ziur/zureh ) [14] 
 coriander seeds ( danival ) [14]  — in Kashmir, it is used in dried form as well as whole seed. It is essential for making pickles and  vari  (Kashmiri Garam Masala). [146] 
 nigella seeds ( siyah dana ) [14] 
 fenugreek seeds ( bresta ) [14]  — used for fish dishes, making  vari , and for making pickles. [142] 
 dry fenugreek leaves ( hoechh mith ) [14] 
 nutmeg ( zafal ) [14] 
 mace ( jalvatier ) [14] 
 soda bi-carb ( phul ) [14] 
 shelled seeds of cucumber, musk melon, water melon and pumpkin ( char magz ) [14] 
 dry crushed mint leaves ( hoekh pudana ) [14] 
 dry garlic ( rohan ) [14] 
 dry shallots ( pran ) [14] 
 vari masala cakes — a quick flavouring agent for many dishes such as  haakh ,  gogjee nadur , spinach, kohlrabi,  razmah gogjee , fish and  shikaar  (game). [14] [149] 
 silver leaf ( varak ) — tissue-thin edible silver sheets used for garnishing pulao and meat dishes. [150] 
 Rock salt consumption is quite old in Kashmir. [151]  It was and is still being imported from Khewrah area of Pakistani Punjab, where it was first discovered by the troops of Alexander the Great in 326 B.C. [151]  Pre-independence, rock salt was imported via Mughal Road, which, before the advent of Mughals, was called  Namak  Route. [151]  After partition, its supply was barred. [151]  Because of its benefits, it is now being consumed by almost one-fourth of the population. [151] 
 
 Specialties by season [ edit ] 
 Spring is often considered a season of rejuvenation after a long and harsh winter. [152]  Picnics, of which the Kashmiris are very fond, are planned around the theme of food. [3]  The countryside is awash with white and pink flowers of almond ( badaam ), peach ( tsunun ) and cherry ( gilaas ) blossoms. [153]  The mustard fields join the show with their bright-yellow blooms. [153]  The pear ( tang ) blossoms can be identified by their thick cluster of flowers. [153]  Apricot ( Tser ) blossoms are white in colour, often tinged with a pink or reddish hue. [153]  They grow from late spring through early summer. [152]  Beans are a spring vegetable. [152]  Cherries are a fruit of late spring and summer. [152]  Coriander ( Danival ) is a cool herb whose season predominates between spring and summer in cooler areas. [152]  Garlic ( Rohan ) is found mainly in spring and through fall season. [152]  Melons ( Kharbooz ) are a fruit grown in spring and summer. [152]  Tender spring-time  haakh  (collard greens) are called  kaanul . [154] 
 The season of harvesting lotus stem ( nadur ) starts in September. [155]  With the onset of autumn the markets are filled with the dried vegetables ( hokh syun ). [156]  Rice harvest begins setting off the  harud  (autumn) spirit. [156]  Going to the countryside, one can see paddy being cut with sickles and then stacked in huge piles to dry. [157]  Chestnuts are roasted in the dying embers. [158]  Saffron fields in full bloom greet you in Pampore, a part of Pulwama district. [157]  Going towards the hilly areas one can see the maize and walnut trees with their fruit getting ready to be harvested. [157]  Going towards the apple producing areas of Sopore in North Kashmir or Shopian in South Kashmir, one can see cartons of apple being transported to various parts of the country. [157] 
 During the long winters the days are short, sunlight and electricity in short supply, so there is not much that can liven up existence except interesting food, so it constitutes a major interest of the Kashmiris' lives. [3]  When all village roads remained blocked due to heavy snowfall and villagers have to use oil lamps or kerosene lanterns, the entire family is called to the kitchen where flavour of the overnight  shab deg  fills the entire space. [159]  Winter food of Kashmir includes all sorts of pulses:  razmah ,  mong ,  masoor ,  channa  and  warimuth . [156]  Kohlrabi ( monje ) is cold tolerant, and continues to grow on the fields in winter, so much that a little frost even helps it. [160]

 Barbecue [ edit ] 
 One version of the origin of kababs is the one in which Turkish soldiers were first known to grill chunks of meat on open fires. [161]  Kashmir's kababs are cooked with local spices and accompanied with dips: [161] 
 
 Kabab , condimented minced meat, roasted or fried, on skewers. [14]  According to chef Ghulam Nabi Dar (aka  Bitte Waaze ), the meat for the kabab is first minced with a very sharp knife ( haché au couteau ), then it requires an egg, cumin, cardamom and garlic, then it needs to be minced some more until it becomes a paste, then it is mounted on 1 m long skewers to be reheated the day after.

 Harisa  is a popular meat preparation made for breakfast, it is slow cooked with spices in a special underground oven for a 24-hour period and hand stirred. [183]  A good  harisa  entails a meticulous mincing of deboned mutton, mixed with local rice, fennel seeds, cinnamon, cardamom and salt.

[426]  Ahdoos's forte was English goodies, and as India inched towards freedom from British Rule he added Kashmiri items to the menu. [426]  Mughal Darbar was established on Residency Road in 1984 and on the road parallel is Jee Enn, founded by Ghulam Nabi Sofi in 1972. [426]  Many of the owners and staff of these new bakeries have trained in Ahdoos. [426]  The variety of pastries include:
 
 Chicken or Mutton Patty , meat seasoned with salt, pepper and garlic, encased in layered puff pastry. [426] 
 Puffs . [426] 
 Cream Rolls . [426] 
 Cream Buns . [426] 
 Coconut Macaroons . [427] 
 Walnut Macaroons . [428] 
 Walnut Tart , made possible by the easy availability of walnut kernels in Kashmir. [426] 
 Walnut Fudge , an exclusivity of Kashmir's Moonlight Bakery, the recipe contains 'snow-white walnuts' from Uri and honey and dates from local market. [429] 
 Other Baked foods [ edit ] 
 The Kashmir Valley is noted for its bakery tradition, that of the  Qandarwan . Nowhere else in the Indian subcontinent can be found such a huge variety of leavened breads, another pointer to the Central Asian influence on Kashmiris' food habits. [5]  On the  Dal Lake  in Kashmir or in downtown Srinagar, bakery shops are elaborately laid out. Bakers sell various kinds of breads with golden brown crusts topped with sesame and poppy seeds.  Tsot  and  tsochvor  are small round breads topped with poppy and sesame seeds, which are crisp and flaky,  sheermal ,  baqerkhayn  (puff pastry),  lavas  (unleavened bread) and  kulcha  are also popular.  Girdas  and  lavas  are served with butter.
 Kashmiri  bakerkhani  has a special place in Kashmiri cuisine. It is similar to a round naan in appearance, but crisp and layered, and sprinkled with sesame seeds. [430]  It is typically consumed hot during breakfast. [431] 
 
 Wazwan [ edit ] 
 This section is an excerpt from  Wazwan . [ edit ] 
   Complete  wazwan  on one platter (or  majma ). This is usually presented to the would-be in-laws before/on the day of the marriage. 
 Wazwan  ( Kashmiri pronunciation:  [waːzɨwaːn] ) is a multi-course meal in Kashmiri cuisine, originating from  Kashmir .
 
Almost all the dishes are meat-based using lamb or chicken with few vegetarian dishes. It is popular throughout the larger  Kashmir  region. Moreover, Wazwan is also served internationally at Kashmiri food festivals and reunions. [432] 
 Beverages [ edit ] 
 Noon Chai or Sheer Chai [ edit ] 
 Kashmiris are heavy tea drinkers. Kashmiris don't use the word "Kashmiri Chai". The word " Noon " in Kashmiri means salt. The most popular drink is a pinkish colored salted tea called " noon chai ." [433]  It is made with black tea, milk, salt and  bicarbonate of soda . The particular color of the tea is a result of its unique method of preparation and the addition of soda. The Kashmiri Hindus more commonly refer to this chai as "Sheer Chai." The  Kashmiri Muslims  refer to it as "Noon Chai" or "Namkeen Chai", both meaning salty tea.
 Noon Chai or Sheer Chai is a common breakfast tea in Kashmiri households and is taken with breads like  baqerkhani  brought fresh from  Qandur (Kashmiri : کاندر )  or bakers. It is one of the most basic and essential food items in a Kashmiri household. Tea was as served in large  samavars . Now, the use of Samavars is limited to special occasions and normally kettles are used.
 Nuts like almonds and pistachios and edible rose petals can also be added before serving and sometimes  malai  or fresh cream is added to give the tea viscosity and richness. [434] 
 
 Lipton chai [ edit ] 
 In Kashmir, chai is essentially salty pink tea. [435]  Anything else is called  Lipton chai  because Lipton was the first brand of tea that came along selling chai. [435] 
 
 Kahwah [ edit ] 
 At marriage feasts, festivals, and religious places, it is customary to serve  kahwah  – a  green tea  made with  saffron , spices, and almonds or walnuts. Over 20 varieties of Kahwah are prepared in different households. Some people also put milk in kahwah (half milk and half kahwah). This chai is also known as "Maugal Chai" by some Kashmiri Hindus from the smaller villages of Kashmir. Kashmiri Muslims and Kashmiri Hindus from the cities of Kashmir refer to it as  Kahwah  or  Qahwah .
 
 Natural Mineral Water [ edit ] 
 From one of the oldest and purest spring waters of Kashmir, the Kokernag Spring, Bringi Spring Water has high alkalinity and is well balanced with minerals. [436] 
 
 Babribyol [ edit ] 
 The  Babribyol sharbat  is a concoction of sweetened milk, rose water or  Rooh Afza  syrup, and soaked sweet basil seeds that are grown locally. [437] 
 
 Lyaess [ edit ] 
 Made from yoghurt or kefir, Kashmiri lassi ( lyaess ) is a liquid, salty way to drink up yoghurt. [438]  The process of churning the buttermilk with a wooden  choomph  or churner is rhythmic and there is an art involved. [438]  The yoghurt has to be churned the right way, the buttery fats have to float to the top in a nice froth, the spices and dried mint leaves have to be just right. [438] 
 
 Sadr-e-kaenz [ edit ] 
 This fermented rice water drink is supposed to be very good for a sluggish liver. [439]

 Food and beverage pairings [ edit ] 
 The traditional Kashmiri wazwan, which comprises slow-cooked meat dishes is a wonderful pairing that enhances the spicy notes of whisky. [441]  The Loire Valley wine  Sancerre  goes well with Kashmiri  goshtabeh . [442]  A ripe fruity red works well with the full bodied  roghan josh . [443]  A recommended wine to try with is Montepulciano. [444] 
 
 Special Occasions & Festivals [ edit ] 
 Eid-ul-Fitr [ edit ] 
 While on fast, Muslims avoid consuming food during the day, while at dusk, they indulge in extra-special, bountiful meals prepared during the day. [445]  The menu for Ramadan month includes  khajur ka laddoo  (date balls),  babribyol  (basil seeds),  kulfi ,  phirin ,  seemni , fruit chaat, fruit custard,  kateer  (a drink loaded with health benefits) and  noon chai . [445]  The smell of slow-cooked mutton hovers, fragrant and sultry in the air, and despite the familiar air of unpredictability in Srinagar, spirits are high and streets are filled with happy greetings of  Eid Mubarak . [163] 
 
 Eid-ul-Adha [ edit ] 
 As the festival draws to a close, most well-to-do families start placing orders with the  wazas  for the feast, which is cooked by chefs at their own places and then sold to the customers for serving at their homes. [446]  Sacrificial animals include Delhi Walla, Merino Cross, Bakerwal and Kashmiri varieties of sheep. [447] 
 
 Urs of Hazrat Sheikh Dawood [ edit ] 
 Only vegetarian food is supplied to devotees. [448]  Majority of people in Batmaloo and adjoining areas turn vegetarian and do not eat meat or chicken. [448]  They widely consume dried turnips ( gogji aare ) because it is believed, during Dawood's time, sundried turnips helped Kashmir survive a famine. [449] 
 
 Urs of Khwaja Masood Wali [ edit ]

 People in Anantnag district in southern Kashmir quit eating meat as a mark of respect for the 16th century mystic. [451]  Rarely is a butcher shop open during these seven days. [451]  For three-and-a-half days each before and after the saint's Urs, people eat radish braised in tamarind. [452] 
 
 Muharram [ edit ] 
 The first ten days of Muharram, that mark the tragedy of Karbala, the milk-based rice pudding  mayir  is prepared. [358]  Throughout the 10th day,  Ashoora ,  kahwa  is served to guests and  mayir  and  sharbat  distributed to mourners on the street. [358]

 Diaspora & fusion cuisines [ edit ] 
 Tibetan exiles in Kashmir, including members of Tibet's small Muslim population live in Srinagar, mainly in a small area near the 18th-century Hari Parbat fort. [455]  Popular  momo  (beef dumplings) shops and Tibetan restaurants are run by their children. [455]  Tibetan options include Cantonese chicken and  kumloo  wonton, fried pasta stuffed with minced mushrooms. [455] 
 Kashmiri Sikh cuisine has a bit of influence from Punjab with onions and tomatoes, but the flavouring goes the Kashmiri way with elements such as  badyaan ( saunf ). [456]  A large number of Indian tourists depend entirely on  Vaishno Dhabas , the Valley's generic non-A/C restaurants that serve all-vegetarian North Indian fare. [457] 
 
 Cooking Methods [ edit ] 
 Kashmiri recipes are meant to be passed down through teaching, from mother to daughter in cramped kitchens, standing together over pots of sputtering oil. [458] 
 
 Braising [ edit ] 
 The leaves of Kashmiri  haakh  are braised in lots of water. [459]  It is very important to ensure that the  haakh  stays submerged underwater during the initial cooking process using a wooden spatula or large spoon to continuously push the greens down. [459]  Mustard oil, which is used extensively in Kashmiri cuisine, imparts an extra flavour to the dish. [459] 
 
 Court-bouillon [ edit ] 
 The main skill of a  wazwan  lies in the preparation of a stock made of onions and shallots. [14] 
 
 Tempering [ edit ] 
 Whole spices must be fried in oil – clove, cardamom, cinnamon, bay leaves. [458]  Fried too little, and the dish will be lifeless, without fragrance. [458]  A second too much, and one will be left with nothing but bitterness. [458] 
 
 Caramelisation [ edit ] 
 Sliced onions are fried until golden brown and pureed with minimal water. [460] 
 
 Emulsification [ edit ] 
 The yoghurt must be fatty, thick. [458]  Dried mint, just a pinch, is added right at the end to freshen the dish. [458] 
 
 Simmering [ edit ] 
 The food gets its flavours and textures from the spices being slow cooked with ingredients until they let out their inherent juices and fats and melt together. [461] 
 
 Dum cooking [ edit ] 
 The cooking vessel in the  shab deg  is sealed with dough before being cooked over a simmering fire through the long winter night. [462] 
 
 Tenderising [ edit ] 
 Goshtabeh  and  rista , the two meatball dishes are rarely found outside the valley because their unique texture is enormously challenging. [461]  The sheep has to be freshly slaughtered and the meat pounded before rigor mortis sets. [461] 
 
 Cooking material [ edit ] 
 The quality of pots is important, according to  wosta  (ustad) or chef Nazir Ahmed Aram. [16]  He says they must have the right content of copper. Using wood (walnut and apple are the best) is important too. Cooking on gas is not the same.
 
 Special Equipment [ edit ] 
 The special equipment used to cook Kashmiri food are:
 
 Dan [ edit ] 
 On normal days the cooking in both Hindu and Muslim homes is mostly done on a  dan , which is an oblong clay oven about 3 ft by 2 ft in length and a foot and a half in height. [463] 
 
 Traem [ edit ] 
 These are large brass plates used for serving food. [463] 
 
 Leij/Deigul/Deigcha [ edit ] 
 Among Kashmiri Pandits, most dishes are cooked in pots of baked clay. Pots used in Kashmir are round-bottomed. [463] 
 
 Tasht-naar [ edit ] 
 These are a portable washbasin and a pitcher that are passed around to wash hands during big banquets. [463] 
 
 Goshpar-Kaen [ edit ] 
 These are a flat coarse stone and a wooden mallet made of walnut wood used for pounding meat to a fine texture. [463] 
 
 Krech [ edit ] 
 These are different kinds of wooden spoons and ladles used for turning the food in clay pots so that the base does not get scraped. [463] 
 
 Khalur-Dula [ edit ] 
 This is a stone mortar with a wooden pestle used for grinding chutneys and pastes. [463] 
 
 Samovar [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Samovar 
 This jug-shaped metallic pitcher has a long tube inside that is filled with charcoal, which keeps the tea in the pot brewing. [463] 
 
 Similarities with other national cuisines [ edit ] 
 Much like Kashmir, its people, and its narrative traditions, Kashmiri cuisine too is an amalgam of influences from Central Asia, Persia, China, and the Indian subcontinent. [464]  Food recipes passed down from one culture to another are:
 
 Aab Gosh  (Kashmiri).  Abgoosht  or  Abgusht  is more so a one-pot Persian comfort food that is a rustic dish with wholesome ingredients. [465]  It has been enjoyed by Persians for centuries. [465]  There is a similar dish in Armenia, called Abgoosht stew, using beef instead of lamb. [466] 
 Baqerkhayn  (Kashmiri).  Bakharkhani  is made in parts of Kolkata. [467]  Some believe it originated in present-day Bangladesh. [467] 
 Batta  (Kashmiri). Short-grain, sticky rice is called  bata  in Afghanistan. [468] 
 Dam Olav  (Kashmiri). Bengali  alur dom  is lightly spiced and slightly sweet potato curry made with onions, tomatoes and spices. [469] 
 Harisa  (Kashmiri).  Al Harees  is a traditional Emirati dish consisting of wheat, meat(chicken) and salt. [470]  A simple, traditional Saudi dish using crushed wheat is called  jareesh . [471]   Harissa , also known as  herisseh ,  harisa  or  keshkeg  in Armenia is a wheat berry and meat porridge. [472]  The wheat, usually known as  korkot , is shelled making them quicker to cook. [472]  In Oman, it is made with beaten rice instead of wheat. [473]   Boko Boko Harees  in Burundian cuisine is a delicacy prepared with chicken, turmeric and bulgur wheat. [474]  In the cities of South of Iran, the dish is called  Hareese  and the meat might be lamb, beef, mutton, turkey or chicken. [475]   Amritsari Hareesa  is a famous dish of the winter season in Lahore, Pakistan and made with wheat and meat. [476]  It is seasoned with desi ghee and served with hot naan. [476] 
 Kabab  (Kashmiri). The Turkish word  kebap  derives from Arabic  kabaab  meaning roasted meat. [477]  A likely East Semitic root means  to burn ,  to char  or  to roast . [477]  The Babylonian Talmud even teaches that offerings in the temple should not be  kabbaba  ( burnt ). [477]  Kysaa-ı Yusuf was the first to refer to meat on skewers as a kebab in 1377. [478]  Ibn Battuta, the famous Moroccan traveller mentioned that  kebab  was an integral part of the daily diet of Indian royalty as early as 1200 AD. [479]  Some of the world's best and most flavorful  kebabs  such as Adana Kebab, Urfa kebab, Iskender kebab come from Turkey's southeastern provinces. [480]  The Döner kebab was invented by İskender Efendi, who lived in Bursa and hung meats vertically to grill. [480]  One of the most popular  kabobs  you can find on the streets of Iran is  kabob koobideh , ground lamb or beef or a combination of the two. [481]  The traditional method of cooking Afghan  chapli kebab  is frying. [482] 
 Kahwah  (Kashmiri). A staple Afghan tea,  kahwah  is mild and fragrant, and recipes tend to differ from family to family. [483] 
 Katlam  (Kashmiri) [484]  Qatlama in traditional Turkish means  folded  which comes from the verb  qatlamaq  (to fold). Plain  katmer  is eaten with Turkish white cheese and Turkish tea. [485]  In Turkmenistan, a type of bread in baked from flour which is mixed with milk and egg. [486]  This is called  katlama . It is also cooked in Azerbaijan, and various herbs are added to it. [487]  The fried Kazakh bread  Kattama  is very popular in Central Asia. [488]   Katama  is an onion-filled swirled flatbread from Kyrgyzstan. [489]  In Uzbekistan,  katlama  is a traditional bread of Sunday mornings served with homemade butter. [490]   Qatlama  is an Afghan fried sweet pastry topped with sugar or sugar syrups. [491]   Qator Gambir  or  Gambir  are Mongolian pancakes which may often be a byproduct, when there is leftover dough from making some other dish. [492]   Kutluma  is a layered Pakistani flatbread with a crispy, buttery texture. [493]   Katlamas  feature regularly on the menus of Bangladeshi restaurants in the UK where they nearly always consist of a layer of spiced lamb encased in a fried pastry. [494] 
 Kulcha  (Kashmiri). In Afghanistan and Northeast Iran, these dried bread biscuits are called  kulcha-e-khataye . [495]   Koloocheh  in Iranian cuisine is a cookie stuffed with cinnamon, sugar and crushed walnuts. [496] 
 Lavasa  (Kashmiri). The word  lavash  is repeatedly found in early Turkic written sources. [497]   Lavash  is a Turkish bread made with flour, water and salt. [498]  It can be eaten hot or cold. [498]  This paper-thin, blanket-sized bread is one of Armenia's most ancient breads and is still being made today. [499]  In Azerbaijan,  lavash  is baked not only in traditional ovens ( tandir ) but also in  saj , a large convex pan under which fire is made. [497]  In Azerbaijan and Iran, it is put on the bride's shoulders or crumbled over her head to wish the couple prosperity. [497] 
 Luchi  (Kashmiri). Very similar, Bengali  luchai  is a deep fried puffed bread. [500] 
 Nabad  (Kashmiri).  Nabat  in Persian is a type of confectionary mineral composed of relatively large sugar crystals, with bits of saffron in it. [501] 
 Nadur  (Kashmiri). In Afghan cuisine,  Qormah e Nadroo  is an onion-and-tomato-based stew using lamb meat or veal, yogurt, lotus roots and coriander. [502] 
 Polav  (Kashmiri). It looks as if  pilaf  was invented in Iran some time after the 10th century. [503]  The Turks call plain rice  sade pilav . [503]  Turkey sees  pilav  primarily as a side dish rather than a main course. [503]  Iran is famous for its  polos  made with aromatic  domsiyah  rice. [503]  The most characteristic ones are based on fruits such as cherries, quinces, or apricots. [503]  In Central Asia, the simplest recipe uses onions, meat and carrots. [503]  The extravagant court traditions of the Moghul school of cookery makes India home to some very elaborate  pulaos . [503]  Laborers from western India brought pilaf to the Caribbean, where it is garnished with butter, almonds and pimiento-stuffed green olives. [503] 
 Roth (Kashmiri). The Afghan version of the universal West Asian and European sweet egg bread is called  rot . [468]  In Afghanistan, it is traditionally served when a newborn child is forty days old. [468] 
 Sheer Chai  (Kashmiri).  Qaimak  or  Sheer chai  is often served at celebrations in Afghanistan to toast good health. [504] 
 Sheermal  (Kashmiri). This bread originated in Persia ( shir  means milk in Farsi) and made its way through the Silk Route to Afghanistan, Pakistan and India. [505] 
 Yakhein  (Kashmiri).  Patates Yahni  or Greek potato stew is a traditional Greek recipe which falls under the category of  ladera , meaning dishes prepared only with olive oil with no addition of other fat. [506]  Turkish  Yahni  is a beef stew that is great in cold weather. [507]  A 19th century cookbook by Mehmet Kamil listed a total of 14 classic  yakhnis . [508]   Yakhni nokhod  is a traditional Shirazi dish that uses meat, peas, potatoes, onions, salt and turmeric. [509] 
 Etiquette of Kashmiri dining [ edit ] 
 Kashmiris are gregarious and like to share. [3]  Language and Food are the two vital parts of the region's identity. [510]  'One who eats properly shall rule the country' it is said. [511]  An interesting wedding tradition from Kashmir involves newlyweds making  roti  together. While the bride flattens the dough and puts it on the griddle, the groom is responsible for flipping it and making sure it is cooked. [512]  Kashmiris are very particular about the taste of dishes. [189]  Food connoisseurs can easily taste a single morsel and name the  waza  who cooked it. [189]  When filmmaker Vivek Agnihotri wrote a presumptuous tweet proposing the idea of vegetarian wazwan, social media erupted in spontaneous protest. [457] 
 In Kashmir, it is said that food should both taste and look good. [14]  Its aroma must be appetizing. Success of a meal lies in its appeal to the eyes, nose and then the tongue. Any event, from a minor one such as receiving a guest in one's home, to a major one such as a circumcision or a wedding, becomes a celebration of preparing, laying out, serving and consuming together the most delicious victuals. [513]  Delicacies are passed on to neighbours to be relished and there is no shame in asking for something when the nostrils are tickled and tempted by the mouth-watering smells from a neighbour's kitchen. [3] 
 Giant  dastarkhaans  (white sheets) are spread on the floor on which the meal is served. [513]  However humble or lofty the fare on it, the  dastarkhaan  has always been the center of warm hospitality and conviviality. [513]  In big Kashmiri dinners, a hundred to five hundred people are usually invited. [14]  Since insurgency and the resultant violence and bloodshed, food has come to hold even greater meaning as each meal signifies a celebration of life itself. [513]  It is worth mentioning that  wazas  (the descendents of Samarkandi cooks), whose shops are located in particular areas of the city of Srinagar, form a significant political group in Kashmir. [513] 
 All dishes are eaten by hand as Kashmiris believe in an intimate relationship with food. [189]  Even spiritual and religious old biddies feel no qualms in chomping on ear cartilage or marrow bones long after the meal is done, pulverising everything into a heap on the thali. [453]  No one bats an eyelid. [453]  Kashmiris consider it disrespectful if one refuses food varieties or an extra helping. [189]  They can go great lengths to persuade, swearing to die if you refuse an extra serving! [189] 
 
 Food-related proverbs [ edit ] 
 Kashmiri language is abundantly rich in proverbs, witty sayings and idiomatic word-combinations. [514]  The proverbs on food themes and situations are:
 
 Adyav kheyiv chinih adyav kheyiv taki  — half the people ate from large dishes, and half from small dishes. [515]  A badly arranged dinner. [516] 
 Akh chhiwyov masah byak hakah rasah  — one man is intoxicated with the juice of the grape, another with juice of vegetables. [517]  Pride dwells in everyone, whether he be rich or poor. [518] 
 Akh duda biyi maji kyut toak  — an uninvited guest wants a ( toak ) plateful for his mother, in addition to himself. [519]   Toak  was an earthen plate, in general use in Kashmir in the past. [520]  Beggars and some uninvited people pushed themselves in among the guests because of their poverty, or their desire for tasting the delicacies. [521]  It is applied where a person is not content with what is willingly offered to him, and demands more. [522] 
 Apih hund gyav  — a foolish woman's ghee. [523]  A foppish person. [524]  Kashmiri people, both wealthy and others, rubbed their hair with fresh ghee. [525] 
 Batah gajih ruhun  — as garlic upon the hearth of a Pandit, so your presence is to me. [526]  The ancestors of the Hindus would not eat garlic because of their aphrodisiac effects, having devoted themselves to religion. [527] 
 Batook Poth  — to have eaten  batook poth  (duck's backside) is an expression in Kashmiri for someone who talks a lot. [528] 
 Chaanis haakhas chha paakuk haajat  — does your  haakh  require hard cooking? [529]  A sort of ironic flattery with the sense that your  haakh  is so delicate, it takes hardly any time to cook. [530] 
 Chaantis animu mathun  — to grease one's mouth with gruel. [531]  To cover up starvation for mere shame. [532] 
 Chayi tani ya gani magar tech gachi cheyn  — tea, whether weak or strong, should be taken hot. [519] 
 Dali Baate ti Khoji thool  — dal for a Pandit and an egg for a Khoja, the kind of food they like. [519] 
 Doori doori marts meethan, nishi nishi naabad tyathaan  — pepper tastes sweet from afar, sugar tastes bitter when too near. [533] 
 Hardas gurus metras, sontah gurus shetras  — autumn butter-milk for the friend, and spring butter-milk for the enemy. Consequently, the milk is better in the autumn. [534] 
 Hari tang tah zulahnai, muhuri tsont tah zulit  — if the pear cost only a cowrie it should not be peeled, but if the apple cost a sovereign it should be peeled. Natives of Kashmir seldom skin a pear, but always skin an apple. [535]  Apple-skin, they say, is not easily digested. [536] 
 Haruch gugaj tah Laruch gunas chhih barabar  — a June turnip and a Lar serpent are equal. A native would not eat June turnip on any account, while  Gunas  is a round-headed serpent met with principally in Lar parganah, whose bite is generally fatal. [537] 
 Majji bhatee  — food served by mother is the best food. [519] 
 Phata Wangun  — a burst eggplant, literally, a sly young man often too clever for his own good. [528] 
 Rogan o zafaran az Pampur, sag az Latapur brinj az Nupur; barrah az Nandapur. Puttu o mahi az Sopur; mong az Kralapur. Arad az Khampur. Shir az Shadipur. Angur az Repur  — Pampore (the place) for ghee and saffron, Letapur for vegetables. Nipur for rice. Nandapur for lamb. Sopore for  pattu  and fish. Kralapur for dal. Khampur for flour. Shadipur for milk. And grapes from Repur. [538] 
 Talwe peyi na tangah  — wishing a pear falls from ceiling is a vain hope. [519] 
 Food Establishments [ edit ] 
 Kashmiri restaurants [ edit ] 
 Ahdoo's first opened its doors as a standalone bakery in 1918. [539]  It branched out into a 60-seater restaurant in 1921. [539]  Today, it boasts of 120 seats. [539]  In the period of militancy in 1995–96, when 99% hotels in Kashmir were shut, it remained open. [539]  Ahdoo's has served Bollywood celebrities like Shammi Kapoor, Dilip Kumar, Amitabh Bachchan, Aditya Roy Kapoor, Karan Johar, and Alia Bhatt, amongst others. [540]  It bore witness to the bloody days of the Partition and served as a refuge for journalists with non-stop deadlines at any time of the day or night, where they were plied with hot food and tea as a fax machine whirred away in the corner. [541]  Haji Mohammad Ibrahim Mugloo brought wazwan to common man by starting Mughal Darbar in 1984. [542]   Lahabi Kabab  is the specialty of New Zum Zum restaurant in central Srinagar. [163]  The dish takes many days to prepare and is soaked in a deep red sauce. [163]  Nestled in barbeque street (Khayam Chowk), Imran Cafeteria was established over 50 years ago by Muhammad Yusuf. [540]  The road here is often jammed come sundown, as locals and tourists make a beeline to the spot for a taste of smoky meat on skewers. [540]  Linz Café first opened in 1975 and for a few decades, this family-run space has firmly established itself in the dietary habits of locals. [540]  The restaurant is reportedly built in the shape of a traditional Kashmiri lock. [540]  Established in 1976, Alka Salka is recommended by locals for the trout delicacies. [540]  Lala Mohammad Sheikh, then a young man from Budgam opened the local go-to for a cup of tea called Lala Sheikh in 1890. [540]  The establishment would host everyone from local shopkeepers and students to writers and politicians. [540]  In fact, around World War 2, Lala Sheikh would serve soldiers, who would pay in gold. [540]  The New York Times shared that the best Kashmiri food in India can be found at Chor Bizarre, New Delhi. [543] 
 
 Banquet staff [ edit ] 
 Wazas  play a key role in Kashmiri society for no celebration of any kind is complete without a banquet. [544]  The  waza  along with his skilled team is hired weeks or months before the occasion. [545]  There's a hierarchy among the team of  wazas . [544]  Given the importance of meat, the crucial task of carving the mutton goes to the head  waza , at the other end of the scale, the junior most helper will do chores like pounding dried red chillies with a dash of water. [544] 
 
 Butchers [ edit ] 
 Meat is an important part of Kashmiri culture, a part of their history. [546]  Kashmiris relish their delicacies without apology. [546]  Meat of different parts is sold at the same price in Kashmir, unlike in western countries. [547]  Cutting, dressing and carving of meat is, so to say, an art. [547]   Puj  in Kashmiri language means a butcher,  pujwan  is a butcher shop. Use of suitable parts of the animal, cut into pieces of proper size for making different dishes, is desirable. [547]

 Famous chefs on Kashmir's food [ edit ] 
 In India [ edit ] 
 For celebrity chef Sanjeev Kapoor, Kashmir's food counts as one of the top three exotic foods of India. [549]  Chef Ranveer Brar loves Kashmiri tea, in which rose petals were added to give the regular milk tea a pinkish tint. [550]  Chef Thomas Zacharias went on a mission to discover unknown culinary gems in Kashmir. [541]  At dawn on his first day, he rode out in a  shikara  to Dal Lake's bustling 150-year-old floating market and came away with boxes of saffron. [15]  Thomas sampled local cheeses and foraged greens in the village of Langanbal, an hour's drive from Srinagar. [15]  Indian Accent's Manish Mehrotra could follow the main course with Kashmiri  haakh saag  broth. [551]  He understands the rootedness of Kashmiri chilli and the way it is used in everyday cooking. [552]  The pioneering food writer Jiggs Kalra at his Delhi restaurant made a dehydrated version of the Kashmiri  nadur churma  topped with red chilli and served with tangy radish and walnut chutney. [553] 
 
 In the UK [ edit ] 
 Madhur Jaffrey's recipe of deep, rust-coloured Kashmiri  roghan josh  saved the British from terrible versions of curry cooked at home involving onions, cooking apple, chuck beef and astringent curry powder. [554]  English celebrity chef Rick Stein couldn't film the cooking of  roghan josh  in Kashmir where the dish comes from because of security reasons but in homage to the classic recipe packs it with flavour. [555]   50 Great Curries of India  by Camellia Panjabi, the world's best-selling curry book, has the unusual recipe of turnips ( gogjee ta maaz ) from Kashmir. [556]  British celebrity cook and restaurateur, Keith Floyd cooked Kashmiri lamb in milk ( aab gosh ) which makes for a nice, subtle, pale curry. [557]  When twice Michelin-starred chef Vineet Bhatia made a proper  rogan josh  in London in the early years, customers complained bitterly calling for British curry house capsicum garnish, so he decided to call it  slow-cooked Kashmiri shank of lamb  and that's when the press started to take notice. [558]  British-based chef and television personality Atul Kochhar tends not to use ghee in  roghan josh  and marinates the meat in spice and yoghurt for a while. [559]  Michelin star chef Rohit Ghai's recipe of  dum aloo  has baby potatoes and Greek yoghurt. [560]  Chef Romy Gill is particularly enthralled by the area of Kashmir, and says she was fascinated by the  wazwan  likening it to the nose to tail movement. [561]  She was inspired by the lamb and vegetarian dishes and when she returned to the U.K., made a whole roast chicken using the Kashmiri spices. [562]  Chef Cyrus Todiwala OBE loves cumin and Kashmiri chillies. [563] 
 
 In the USA [ edit ] 
 Michelin star chef Vikas Khanna is a huge fan of Kashmiri cuisine. [564]  Chef Chintan Pandya of Adda Indian Canteen in Long Island City combines cumin, chili and musky lamb to cook his Kashmiri lamb ribs. [565]  Pandya says the inspiration for the dish is a Kashmiri classic called  tabak maaz , where the lamb is first cooked in milk and then browned in butter. [566]  Guy Fieri featured Kashmiri lamb  roghan josh  on his TV show Diners, Dive-Ins, and Drives. [567]  Anthony Bourdain was hoping to shoot in Kashmir and was excited about visiting but the security situation there was problematic. [568]  Food and wine expert  Antoni Porowski  was shocked by the amount of garlic in traditional Kashmiri dishes, but loves the really thick  dhals . [569]  Mike Bagale, who, until recently, was the executive chef at Alinea in Chicago, one of America's most sought after dining experience, stopped in Srinagar at a spice shop and could smell the cinnamon as he approached it. [570]  At his work station, instead of charcoal, his brazier is filled with cinnamon sticks and the aroma of cinnamon envelops the kitchen. [570] 
 
 In Australia [ edit ] 
 Melbourne-based chef Gary Mehigan, popularly known for his 12-year long stint as a judge on MasterChef Australia found the creatively plated Kashmiri morels with goat's testicles at the Indian restaurant Bombay Canteen interesting. [571] 
 
 Contemporary Kashmiri cuisine [ edit ] 
 Prateek Sadhu, formerly at Masque (Mumbai) is mining his Kashmiri roots to win international fame. [572]  His food is characterised by dishes such as lobster roghan josh, roghan josh sausages [572]  and raisin-glazed quail served with a yakhni broth. [573] [574]  He sourced quince from Kashmir and made an ice-cream with it. [575]  Entrepreneur Tariq Ahmad, the 'Pizza Man' of Kashmir, set chicken on roti and sold it to customers in wazwan loving Kashmir. [576]  US-based Kashmiri entrepreneur Uffaq Mattu ships chicken patties, harissa bites, shaami kabaab burgers, crumbled  tschaman  and  tamatar  pizzas to almost all the 50 states in the US. [577]  At her Uffi's Kitchen, French fries were replaced with  Nadir Monje , and chicken wings by  waaze kokur  wings. [577]  At Rooh, San Francisco, they make the signature dish of  tabakh maaz  with Californian Superior Lamb, and French braising techniques. [578]  Helly Raichura, chef-founder of EnterViaLaundry in Melbourne has 10-course degustations serving Gujarati  khandvi  with Kashmiri chilli oil. [579]  Noon in Mumbai has kimchi fermented with Kashmiri red chillies. [580]  2019 Masterchef Australia contestant Sandeep Pandit was born in Kashmir, and cooks  tamatar gaad  (tomato fish) using Australian barramundi. [581] 
 
 Sustainable consumption [ edit ] 
 Kashmiri women would previously take extra mutton dishes by packing them in old newspapers or plastic bags that they would carry. [582]  With time, this tradition became popular, and men soon began travelling with the remaining mutton on their  traem  ( wazwan  copper dish). [582]  In Kashmir, taking leftover food into carrying bags evolved into a movement, and people also granted it social legitimacy. [582]  Even the elites have joined the cause and begun providing specially made carry bags of leftover food. [582]  Even the leftover rice is not wasted in marriage functions and is served to animals (dogs, cattle etc.). [583]
