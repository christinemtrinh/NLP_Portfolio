 Telangana cuisine  is the cuisine native to the  Indian state  of  Telangana . The  Telangana  state lies on the Deccan plateau and its topography dictates more  millets  and  roti  based dishes.  Jowar  and  Bajra  features more prominently in their cuisine. 
 
 Staple food [ edit ] 
 Telangana  in its cuisine, there is special place for rotis made from millet, such as  jonna rotte  ( sorghum ),  sajja rotte  (penisetum), or  Sarva Pindi" and Uppudi Pindi  (broken rice). In Telangana a gravy or curry is called  Koora  and  Pulusu in based on  Tamarind . A deep fry reduction of the same is called  Vepudu .  Kodi pulusu  and vepudu  are popular dishes in meat.  Vankaya ( Brinjal ) ,  Aloogadda ( potato ) koora & fry  are some of the many varieties of vegetable dishes. [1]   Telangana palakoora  is a  spinach  dish cooked with  lentils   eaten with steamed  rice  and  rotis .  Peanuts  are added as special attraction and in  Karimnagar District ,  cashew  nuts are added.
 Popular  Telangana  curry dishes (known as  Koora ) include  Boti  (derived from mutton) and  Phunti  Koora  made out of Red Sorrel leaves.  Potlakaya pulusu , or  Snake gourd  stew is one of the daily staple dish.Many Telangana dishes are altered as per their own taste but the root ingredients are similar.  Sakinalu  is the most popular snack made of rice flour during festivals like Dusshera and Sankranthi making it very delicious and one of its kind  fritters of South India. [2] 
 Recent years has seen a resurgence of Telangana cuisines in restaurants around  Hyderabad  with the availability of Telangana thali dish for lunch. [3]
