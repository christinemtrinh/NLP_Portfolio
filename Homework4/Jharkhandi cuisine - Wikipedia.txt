   Location map of the Indian state of  Jharkhand 
 Jharkhandi cuisine  encompasses the  cuisine  of the Indian  state  of  Jharkhand . Staple foods of Jharkhand are  rice ,  dal  and  vegetables . [1]  Common meals often consist of vegetables that are cooked in various ways, such as curried, fried, roasted and boiled. [2]  Many traditional dishes of  Jharkhand may not be available at restaurants. [3]  However, on a visit to a local village, one can get a chance to experience such exotic foods. Some  dish  preparations may be mild with low oil and spice content, although  pickles  and festive dishes may have such characteristics.

[19]  In the past, food supplies were distributed to the districts in phases, which some have criticized as problematic. [19]  In June 2015,  Ram Vilas Paswan , the  Minister of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution  for the government of India stated a preference toward the Food Security Act to be implemented all at once, rather than in phases. [19]  In this manner, Paswan stated a preference for distributions to be completed in entirety by September 1, 2015. [19]
