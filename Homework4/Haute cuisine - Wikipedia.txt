   An example of French  haute cuisine  presentation 
 Haute cuisine  ( French:  [ot kɥizin] ;  lit.   'high cooking') or  grande cuisine  is the  cuisine  of "high-level" establishments, gourmet restaurants, and luxury hotels. [ citation needed ]   Haute cuisine  is characterized by the meticulous preparation and careful presentation of food at a high price.
 
 
 Early history [ edit ] 
 Haute cuisine  represents the cooking and eating of carefully prepared food from regular and premium ingredients, prepared by specialists, and commissioned by those with the financial means to do so.  It has had a long evolution through the monarchy and the  bourgeoisie  and their ability to explore and afford prepared dishes with exotic and varied flavors and looking like architectural wonders.  Haute cuisine  distinguished itself from regular French cuisine by what was cooked and served, by obtaining premium ingredients such as fruit out of season, and by using ingredients not typically found in France. [1] 
 Trained kitchen staff was essential to the birth of  haute cuisine  in France, which was organized at the turn of the century [ clarification needed ]  by  August Escoffier  into the  brigade de cuisine . The extravagant presentations and complex techniques that came from these kitchens required ingredients, time, equipment, and therefore money. For this reason, early  haute cuisine  was accessible to a small demographic of rich and powerful individuals. Not only were professional chefs responsible for building and shaping  haute cuisine , but their role in the cuisine was what differentiated it from regular French cuisine. [2] 
 Haute cuisine  is influenced by  French cuisine  with elaborate preparations and presentations that serves small, multiple courses prepared by a hierarchical kitchen staff, historically at the grand restaurants and hotels of Europe. The cuisine was very rich and opulent, with decadent sauces made out of butter, cream, and flour, the basis for many typical French sauces still in use today. [3]  The 17th-century chef and writer  La Varenne  (1615-1678) marked a change from cookery as known in the  Middle Ages , to somewhat lighter dishes, and more modest presentations. Subsequently,   Antonin Carême  (1784-1833) also published works on cooking, and he simplified and codified an earlier and even more complex cuisine. Nineteenth-century French  haute cuisine  interacted with the development of  fine dining  in  Britain . [4] 
 
 Cuisine classique [ edit ] 
 Georges Auguste Escoffier  is a central figure in the modernisation of  haute cuisine  as of about 1900, which became known as  cuisine classique . These were simplifications and refinements of the early work of Carême,  Jules Gouffé  and  Urbain Dubois . It was practised in the grand restaurants and hotels of Europe and elsewhere for much of the 20th century. The major developments were to replace  service  à la française  (serving all dishes at once) with  service  à la russe  (serving meals in courses) and to develop a system of cookery, based on Escoffier's  Le Guide Culinaire , which formalized the preparation of sauces and dishes.  In its time, it was considered the pinnacle of  haute cuisine , and was a style distinct from  cuisine bourgeoise  (the cuisine of affluent city dwellers), the working-class cuisine of  bistros  and homes, and cuisines of the French provinces.

 Nouvelle cuisine [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Nouvelle cuisine 
 The 1960s were marked by the appearance of  nouvelle cuisine , as chefs rebelled from Escoffier's "orthodoxy" and complexity. Although the term  nouvelle cuisine  had been used in the past, the modern usage can be attributed to authors  André Gayot , [5]   Henri Gault , and  Christian Millau , who used  nouvelle cuisine  to describe the cooking of  Paul Bocuse ,  Alain Chapel , Jean and  Pierre Troisgros ,  Michel Guérard ,  Roger Vergé  and  Raymond Oliver , many of whom were once students of  Fernand Point . [6] 
 In general,  nouvelle cuisine  puts an emphasis on natural flavours, so the freshest possible ingredients are used, preparation is simplified, heavy sauces are less common, as are strong marinades for meat, and cooking times are often reduced.  Nouvelle cuisine  was a movement towards  conceptualism  and  minimalism  and was a direct juxtaposition to earlier  haute cuisine  styles of cooking, which were much more extravagant. While menus were increasingly short, dishes used more inventive pairings and relied on inspiration from regional dishes. [6] 
 Within 20 years, however, chefs began returning to the earlier style of  haute cuisine , although many of the new techniques remained. [6]
