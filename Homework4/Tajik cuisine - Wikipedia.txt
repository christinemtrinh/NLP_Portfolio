 Traditional cuisine of Tajikistan 
   A Tajik feast 
 Tajik cuisine  is a traditional  cuisine  of  Tajikistan , and has much in common with  Russian ,  Afghan ,  Iranian  and  Uzbek  cuisines.  Plov  ( pilaf ) ( Tajik :  палав ,  Uzbek :  palov ), also called  osh  ( Tajik :  ош ), is the national dish in Tajikistan, as in other countries in the region.  Green tea  is the national drink.
 
 
 Common foods and dishes [ edit ] 
   Eating  qurutob  the traditional way: with one's hands 
 Palav or osh, generically known as  plov  ( pilaf ), is a  rice  dish made with shredded  yellow turnip  or  carrot , and pieces of  meat , all fried together in  vegetable oil  or mutton fat in a special  qazan  (a  wok -shaped  cauldron ) over an open flame. The meat is cubed, the carrots are chopped finely into long strips, and the rice is colored yellow or orange by the frying carrots and the oil. The dish is eaten communally from a single large plate placed at the center of the table, often in with one's hands in the traditional way.
 Another traditional dish that is still eaten with hands from a communal plate is  qurutob  ( Tajik :  қурутоб ), whose name describes the preparation method:  qurut  ( Tajik :  қурут , dried balls of salty cheese) is dissolved in water ( Tajik :  об ,  ob ) and the liquid is poured over strips of а thin  flaky  flatbread ( patyr  or  fatir ,  Tajik :  фатир , or more accurately фатир равғанӣ,  fatir ravghani , i.e., fatir made with butter or tallow for flakiness). Before serving the dish is topped with onions fried in oil until golden and other fried vegetables. No meat is added.  Qurutob  is considered the  national dish .

 Meals are almost always served with  non  ( Tajik :  нон ),  flatbread  found throughout  Central Asia . If a  Tajik  has food but not  non , he will say he is out of food. If  non  is dropped on the ground, people will put it up on a high ledge for beggars or birds. Legend holds that one is not supposed to put  non  upside down because this will bring bad luck. The same holds if anything is put on top of the  non , unless it is another piece of  non . [1] 
 Breakfast usually consists of tea, kulcha (Tajik flatbread) or non with butter, kolbasa (sausage-like meat product), smetana (sour cream), kaymak, jam, Nutella, and eggs. Fruits such as berries, grapes, apples, peaches, and apricots are eaten too during the Summer. Kompot (a non-alcoholic sweet beverage that may be served hot or cold and is made with fruits) is often drunk as well.
 Traditional Tajik soups include mainly meat and vegetable soups (such as  shurbo  and  piti ), and meat soups with noodles (such as  laghmon  and  ugro ). Other dishes shared regionally, either as fast food or as an appetizer, include  manti  (steamed meat dumplings),  tushbera  ( pelmeni ),  sambusa  (a triangular  pastry  with either a meat and onion stuffing or a pumpkin and onion stuffing, baked in a  tandoor  oven), and  belyash  (pl.  belyashi ,  Tajik :  беляши , deep-fried cakes made of yeast dough and filled with minced meat, similar to  pirozhki ).
 Soviet cuisine  both influenced and was in turn influenced by Tajik cuisine. [2] 
 
 Dairy products [ edit ] 
 Dairy  dishes, usually served as part of the spread of appetizers in a Tajik meal and scooped with pieces of flatbread, include  chaka  (a sour milk preparation), thick  yogurt , and  kaymak  (high-fat clotted cream).  Qurut  balls may be served as a snack or an accompaniment to cold beverages. Although not a traditional Tajik drink,  kefir , a drinking  yogurt , is often served with  breakfast .
 
 Summer produce [ edit ] 
 In the summer, Tajikistan abounds in  produce  and  fruit ; its  grapes  and  melons  were famous throughout the former  Soviet Union . The  bazaar  also sells  pomegranates ,  apricots ,  plums ,  peaches ,  apples ,  pears ,  figs , and  persimmons .
 
 Beverages [ edit ] 
 Tea  generally accompanies every meal and is frequently offered between meals as a gesture of hospitality to guests and visitors. It is served hot in a china pot with a lid, and is drunk with  sugar  from small saucer-less cups without handles ( piola ). Because of the universal popularity of tea-drinking, the  choykhona , or teahouse, is the most common gathering place in Tajikistan, and is similar to the Western-style  coffee house .
