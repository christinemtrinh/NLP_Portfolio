   A  Mauritian Creole  dish of  curry  with  rice  and a  salad 
 The  cuisine of Mauritius  is heavily influenced by the  tropical  location of the island as well as the  cultural diversity  which characterizes the country. [1]  Mauritian cuisine is a blend of  African ,  Chinese ,  European  (mainly  French ) and  Indian  influences in the history of  Mauritius . [1] [2] [3] [4]  Most of the dishes and culinary traditions are inspired by French culture, former African slaves, and Indian workers and Chinese migrants arriving during the 19th century. [5] [4]  Over the years, communities found in Mauritius have adapted and mixed each other's cuisine to their liking, resulting in the development of Mauritian cuisine. [6]  While some popular dishes and desserts are consumed by Mauritians of all ethnic groups or communities, there are also form of cuisines which remain distinctly ethnic and are unique to a specific ethnic community due to their ancestral cultural and historical connections. [1]  Local food which varies depending on ethnic communities therefore reflects the strong traditional, cultural, and historical influences of each community. [1] 
 Dishes from  French cuisine  have grown very popular in  Mauritius . [ citation needed ]   Sino-Mauritian  cuisine is one of the most prevalent in the restaurants throughout the island. [6]

[3] [7] [1]

 History [ edit ] 
 Dutch influences [ edit ] 
 During the Dutch Period (1598-1710 AD),  sugarcane  (from Java) was first introduced to the  island . [17] [18] [5]  At the time, Sugarcane was mainly cultivated for the production of  arrack , a precursor to rum. [18] [5]  It wasn't until 60 years later that sugar as we know it was produced. [5] 
 In 1639,  deer  from Java island were brought to Mauritius by the Dutch governor,  Adrian Van Der Stel , for  livestock  purposes. [19]  Following a cyclone, the deer broke free and returned to the wild. [19] 
 
 Dishes with dodos [ edit ] 
   Mauritius was the only known habitat of the now-extinct  dodo  bird 
 When it was discovered, the island of Mauritius was the home of a previously unknown species of bird, the  dodo . Dodos were descendants of a type of  pigeon  which settled in Mauritius over 4 million years ago. With no predators to attack them, they lost their need and ability to fly.
 In 1505, the Portuguese became the first humans to set foot on Mauritius. The island quickly became a stopover for ships engaged in the spice trade. Weighing up to 50 pounds (23 kg), the dodo was a welcome source of fresh meat for the sailors. Large numbers of dodos were killed for food.
 Later, when the Dutch used the island as a penal colony, new species were introduced to the island.  Rats , pigs and  monkeys  ate dodo eggs in the ground nests. The combination of human exploitation and introduced species significantly reduced the dodo population. Within 100 years of the arrival of humans on Mauritius, the once-abundant dodo became a rare bird. [ citation needed ]  The last one was killed in 1681. [20]  The dodo is prominently featured as a  supporter  of the  coat of arms of Mauritius .
 
 French and British influences [ edit ] 
 Franco-Mauritian cuisine [ edit ] 
   A fish dish at a restaurant in Mauritius Mauritius has had strong ties with French culture throughout its history and was deeply influenced by the French people's  "savoir vivre" . [6]  French hunting traditions have also influenced Mauritian cuisine in the use of  venison  and wild boar, which is typically served on domaines or estates, restaurants and hotels. [3]  As years passed by, some have been adapted to the more exotic ingredients of the island to confer some unique flavour. [5]  French influences in Mauritian cuisine can be found in the consumption of Rougailles (light stew) scented with thyme,  Daube  (i.e. chicken or beef stew),  croissants ,  baguette bread ,  bouillon ,  tuna salad ,  civet de lièvre  and  coq au vin  served with good wine. [6] [4] [3]  Many forms of French desserts and cakes were influenced by the Franco-Mauritians and can also be found in  France ; [1] [5]  such as tarts. [4]  French tarts and milk coffee is well-like by Franco-Mauritians. [1]

 Anglo-Mauritian cuisine [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Tea culture 
 The liking for afternoon tea in Mauritius is an influence from the British who took over the island in 1810. [4] 
 
 Sino-Mauritian cuisine [ edit ] 
 Main article:  List of Sino-Mauritian dishes 
 Sino-Mauritian  cuisine includes both Chinese cuisine (transmitted from their ancestors and recently learnt through journeys to China) and localization of Chinese cuisine. [21]  Sino-Mauritian cuisine typically consist of fried vegetables, oyster sauce, fried rice, meat, and fish. [1] 
 The 19th century saw the arrival of Chinese migrants, who came mostly from the south-eastern part of  China ; [6]  these Chinese migrants were mainly  Cantonese  from  Guandong ,  Hakka  from  Meixian  and Chinese people from  Fujian . [22]  Chinese migrants mainly lived in harmony in the  Chinatown  in the capital of  Port Louis  and shared their culture with other communities. [22]  They are largely credited for making  noodles , both steamed and fried, and  fried rice  popular. [1] [8]  Sino-Mauritians also follow and/or have maintained some Chinese food traditions and customs. For example, the tradition of  Chinese red eggs  which are shared with family members. [22]  It is customary for Sino-Mauritians to eat  fried noodles  on birthday celebrations. [11] : 104  
 Between the 20th and 21st century, some Sino-Mauritian returned to China to learn new culinary dishes and returned to Mauritius introducing new dishes in their restaurant in Mauritius. [23]  In the 21st century, Sino-Mauritians, who resided overseas (e.g. in  China ,  Taiwan ) for a few years before returning to Mauritius, also introduced new Chinese food and drinks culture in Mauritius. For example,  Bubble tea  drinking culture was introduced by Fabrice Lee, a Sino-Mauritian, who in lived in Taiwan for 8 years before returning in Mauritius. [24]  The first bubble tea shop in  Mauritius  opened in late 2012; since then, there are bubble tea shops in most  shopping malls  on the island, becoming a popular place for teenagers to hangout.

 Indo-Mauritian cuisine [ edit ] 
 Following the abolition of slavery, Indian workers who migrated to Mauritius during the 19th century brought their cuisine with them. [6]  Those indentured labourers came from different parts of India, each with their own culinary tradition, depending on the region. [6]  Traces of both northern and southern Indian cuisine can be found in Mauritius. [5]  As they are the majority population in Mauritius, they are largely contributed for making  rice  the staple dish. [1]  Dholl-puri and roti which are Indian-origins delicacies have become a common popular form of food for all Mauritians regardless of ethnicities. [6] 
 Indo-Mauritian cuisine used common ingredients, such as dals (i.e.  yellow-split peas ), vegetables, beans, and pickles to accompany the dishes. It also uses extensive amount of spices; common spices include: saffron, cinnamon, cardamon, and cloves. [6]

 Rum industry [ edit ] 
   Rum  from Mauritius 
 During the French and English administration, sugar production was fully exploited, considerably contributing to the economic development of the island. [ citation needed ] 
 François Mahé de Labourdonnais  was the first person to support the development of rum industry in Mauritius. [17]  When Mauritius became a British colony, the plantation economy was mainly sugar cane. [17]  It was Dr. Pierre Charles François Harel who in 1850s initially proposed the concept of local distillation of rum in Mauritius. [17]  Mauritius today houses four distilleries ( Grays , Medine, Chamarel and St Aubin) and is in the process of opening an additional three. [ citation needed ] 
 
 Tea industry [ edit ] 
 Tea plant  was introduced in Mauritius in 1760 by a French priest, Father Galloys. In 1770, Pierre Poivre planted tea plants on large scale. However, it was only in the 19th century under British rule that commercial tea cultivation was encouraged by  Robert Farquhar , the Governor of Mauritius. Robert Farquhar had a tea garden at Le Reduit; however when he left Mauritius, no one  was interested in his project.  Sir John Pope Hennessy , the 15th Governor of Mauritius, later revived local interest in tea cultivation and a tea plantation at Nouvelle France and at Chamarel. [15]
