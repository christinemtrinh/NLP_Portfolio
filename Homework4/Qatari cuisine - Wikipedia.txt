 Qatari cuisine  is made up of  traditional  Arab cuisine. [1]   Machbūs , a meal consisting of  rice ,  meat , and  vegetables , is the  national dish  in  Qatar , typically made with either lamb or chicken and slow-cooked to give it a depth of flavour. [2] [1]   Seafood  and  dates  are staple food items in the country. [3]  Many of these dishes are also used in other countries in the region, because they share many commonalities. In other parts of the region some of the dishes have different names or use slightly different ingredients. [4]  One proponent of the importance of Qatar's culinary heritage is chef  Noor Al Mazroei , who adapts traditional recipes to include  vegan  and  gluten-free  alternatives. [5]
