 Culinary traditions of Guinea-Bissau 
   Location of  Guinea-Bissau 
   People sharing a meal in Bissau, the capital. 
 Bissau-Guinean cuisine  is the food culture of  Guinea-Bissau , a nation on  Africa 's west coast along the  Atlantic Ocean . Rice is a staple in the diet of residents near the coast and millet a staple in the interior. Much of the rice is imported and  food insecurity  is a problem [1]  in large part due to  coups , corruption and inflation. [2]   Cashews  are grown for export.  Coconut ,  palm nut , and  olives  are also grown. [3] 
 Fish, shellfish, fruits and vegetables are commonly eaten along with  cereal grains , milk,  curd  and  whey . The Portuguese encouraged  peanut  production.  Vigna subterranea  (Bambara groundnut) and  Macrotyloma geocarpum  (Hausa groundnut) are also grown.  Black-eyed peas  are also part of the diet.  Palm oil  is harvested.
 Common dishes include  soups  and  stews . Common ingredients include  yams ,  sweet potato ,  cassava , onion, tomato and  plantain . Spices, peppers and chilis are used in cooking, including  Aframomum melegueta  seeds (Guinea pepper).
 
 Celebrations [ edit ] 
 September 12 is  Amilcar Cabral 's birthday, a celebration that includes the eating of  yassa , chicken prepared with  mustard ,  citrus  and onion. Other holidays and festivals include Carnival in February, Colonization Martyr's Day on August 3, Readjustment Movement Day in November, Independence Day on September 24th, Mocidade Day on December 1 and New Year Day.
 Family ceremonies to mark birth,  circumcision , marriage, and death are celebrated with  palm wine  or  rum .  Animal sacrifice  is also performed. [4]
