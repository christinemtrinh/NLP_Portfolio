 Rajasthan Portal v t e 
 Rajasthani cuisine  ( Hindi :  राजस्थानी व्यञ्जन ) is the cuisine of the rugged  Rajasthan  region in  North West India . It was influenced by both the warlike lifestyles of its inhabitants and the availability of ingredients in an arid region. [1]  Food that could last for several days and could be eaten without heating was preferred. Scarcity of water and fresh green vegetables have all had their effect on the cooking. It is also known for its snacks like  Bikaneri bhujia ,  Mirchi bada  and  Pyaaj kachori . Other famous dishes include  Dal Baati ,  malaidar special lassi  (lassi) and  Lashun ki chutney  (hot garlic paste),  Mawa lassi  from  Jodhpur , Alwar ka mawa,  Malpauas  from  Pushkar  and  rasgulla  from  Bikaner , "paniya"and "gheriya" from  Mewar . [1]  Originating for the  Marwar  region of the state is the concept  Marwari Bhojnalaya , or vegetarian  restaurants, today found in many parts of India, which offer vegetarian food of the  Marwari people . The history also has its effect on the diet as the Rajputs preferred majorly a non-vegetarian diet while the Brahmin, Jains, and others preferred a vegetarian diet. So, the state has a myriad of both types of delicacies. [2] 
 According to a 2014 survey released by the registrar general of India, Rajasthan has 74.9% vegetarians, which makes it the most vegetarian state in India. [3] 
 
 
 Rajput cuisine [ edit ] 
 Rajasthani cuisine is also influenced by the  Rajputs , who are predominantly non-vegetarians. Their diet consisted of  game meat  and  dishes like Laal maas (meat in red gravy), Safed maas (meat in white gravy) and Jungli maas (game meat cooked with basic ingredients). [4] [5] [6] 
 
 Sweet dishes [ edit ] 
 Sweet dishes are never referred to as 'dessert' in Rajasthan, because unlike desserts which are served after the meal, Rajasthani sweets are served before, during and after the meal.
