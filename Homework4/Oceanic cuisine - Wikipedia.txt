 Cuisine native to the South Pacific 
 
 The  cuisines  of Oceania  include those found on  Australia ,  New Zealand , and  New Guinea , and also cuisines from many other islands or island groups throughout  Oceania .
 Since the region of Oceania consists of islands, seafood is a prominent part of the diet, with vegetables such as  potatoes ,  sweet potato ,  taro  and  yams  being the main starch.  Coconut , and its derivative products such as  coconut milk ,  coconut oil  and  coconut sugar , is an important ingredient in the tropics of Oceania.
 One of the most distinctive styles of cooking throughout Oceania is the  earth oven , a method which involves laying food on hot rocks and burying it in earth. The technique originated in Papua New Guinea and was subsequently spread by  Austronesian  seafarers.
 
 
 Australia [ edit ] 
 Other than by climate and produce availability, Australian cuisine has been influenced by the tastes of settlers to Australia. [1]  The British colonial period established a strong base of interest in  Anglo - Celtic  style recipes and methods. Later influences developed out of multicultural immigration and included  Chinese ,  Japanese ,  Malaysian ,  Thai , and  Vietnamese  cuisines.  Mediterranean cuisine  influences from  Greek cuisine ,  Italian cuisine , and  Lebanese cuisine  influences are strong, also influences from  French cuisine ,  Indian cuisine ,  Spanish cuisine , and  Turkish cuisine ,  German cuisine , and  African cuisine . Regional Australian cuisines commonly use locally grown vegetables based on seasonal availability, and Australia also has large fruit growing regions. The  Granny Smith  variety of apples originated in Sydney, Australia in 1868. [2]  In the Southern states of  Victoria  and South Australia, in particular the  Barossa Valley , wines and food reflects the region's traditions and heritage. [3]  Australia's climate makes  barbecues  commonplace. Barbecue stalls selling  sausages  and fried onion on  white bread  with tomato or  barbecue sauce  are common.

 Polynesia [ edit ] 
 Polynesian cuisine  encompasses the culinary practices of  Polynesia , an area notably defined as the  Polynesian Triangle  and occasionally, the  Polynesian outliers  that have been settled by  Polynesian  seafarers. The vast area of Polynesia has had a great influence on the cuisine itself, differing as a result of climate, geography and neighbouring island groups, such as the practice of harvesting and boiling down  coconut sap  in the atolls from  Micronesian peoples  or the harvesting and processing of  Sago  in the outliers from  Melanesians . Polynesian cuisine has been influenced by the  traditional ingredients  and preparations of the Polynesians, as well as  European ,  Asian  and  American  culinary practices. The Polynesian cuisine had influenced the  Malagasy cuisine .
