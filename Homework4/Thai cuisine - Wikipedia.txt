 Thai cuisine  ( Thai :  อาหารไทย ,  RTGS :  ahan thai ,  pronounced  [ʔāː.hǎːn tʰāj] ) is the national  cuisine  of  Thailand .
 Thai cooking places emphasis on lightly prepared dishes with strong  aromatic  components and a spicy edge. Australian chef  David Thompson , an expert on Thai food, observes that unlike many other cuisines, [1]  Thai cooking is "about the juggling of disparate elements to create a harmonious finish. Like a complex musical chord it's got to have a smooth surface but it doesn't matter what's happening underneath. Simplicity isn't the dictum here, at all."
 Traditional Thai cuisine loosely falls into four categories:  tom  (boiled dishes),  yam  (spicy salads),  tam  (pounded foods), and  kaeng  (curries). Deep-frying, stir-frying and steaming are methods introduced from  Chinese cuisine . [2] 
 In 2017, seven Thai dishes appeared on a list of the "World's 50 Best Foods", an online poll of 35,000 people worldwide by  CNN Travel . Thailand had more dishes on the list than any other country:  tom yam kung  (4th),  pad thai  (5th),  som tam  (6th),  massaman curry  (10th),  green curry  (19th),  Thai fried rice  (24th) and  nam tok mu  (36th). [3] 
 
 
 History [ edit ] 
 Historical influences [ edit ] 
   The art of  vegetable carving  is thought to have originated in the  Sukhothai Kingdom  nearly 700 years ago. [4] 
 Thai cuisine and the culinary traditions and cuisines of Thailand's neighbors, especially India,  Malaysia and Indonesia, have mutually influenced one another over the course of many centuries.
 According to the Thai monk Venerable  Buddhadasa  Bhikku's writing, ‘India's Benevolence to Thailand’, Thai cuisine was  influenced  by  Indian cuisine . He wrote that Thai people learned how to use  spices  in their food in various ways from Indians. Thais also obtained the methods of making  herbal medicines  from the Indians. Some plants like sarabhi of the family  Guttiferae , panika or  harsinghar , phikun or  Mimusops elengi  and bunnak or the  rose chestnut  etc. were brought from India. [5]  According to a book 'Mae Krua Hua Pa' (first published in 1908) by Lady Plian Bhaskarawongse (ท่านผู้หญิงเปลี่ยน ภาสกรวงษ์), she found that Thai cuisine had had a strong gastronomical cultural line from Sukhothai (1238–1448) through Ayuttthaya (1351–1767) and Thonburi period (1767–1782) vis-à-vis Siamese governmental officers' daily routines (such as royal cooking) and their related cousins. Thai food during the Thonburi period tended to be more similar to that from the Ayutthaya period, except the addition of Chinese food resulted from her prosperous international trade. [6] [7] 
 
   Chili peppers , originally from the Americas, were introduced to Thailand by the Portuguese and Spanish. 
 Western influences, starting in 1511 when the first diplomatic mission from the  Portuguese  arrived at the court of Ayutthaya, have created dishes such as  foi thong , the Thai adaptation of the Portuguese  fios de ovos , and  sangkhaya , where coconut milk replaces cow's milk in making a custard. [8]  These dishes were said to have been brought to Thailand in the 17th century by  Maria Guyomar de Pinha , a woman of mixed  Japanese - Portuguese - Bengali  ancestry who was born in Ayutthaya, and became the wife of  Constantine Phaulkon , a Greek adviser to  King Narai . The most notable influence from the West must be the introduction of the  chili pepper  from the  Americas  in the 16th or 17th century. It, and rice, are now two of the most important ingredients in Thai cuisine. [9]  During the  Columbian Exchange ,  Portuguese  and  Spanish  ships brought new foodstuffs from the Americas including  tomatoes ,  corn ,  papaya ,  pea eggplants ,  pineapple ,  pumpkins ,  culantro , cashews, and peanuts.
 
 Regional variations [ edit ] 
 Regional variations tend to correlate to neighboring states (often sharing the same cultural background and  ethnicity  on both sides of the border) as well as climate and geography. Northern Thai cuisine shares dishes with  Shan State  in Burma, northern  Laos , and also  with Yunnan  Province in China, whereas the cuisine of  Isan  (northeastern Thailand) is similar to  that of Southern Laos ,and by  Vietnamese cuisine  to its east. Southern Thailand, with many dishes that contain liberal amounts of  coconut milk  and fresh  turmeric , has that in common with  Indian ,  Malaysian , and  Indonesian cuisine . [10] 
 Thai cuisine is more accurately described as five regional cuisines, corresponding to the five main  regions of Thailand :
 
 Bangkok : although it originated in the capital city, because of its legacy, it can be found nationwide, it's modification of  Teochew cuisine  with some  Portuguese  influences. In addition, as a capital city, Bangkok cuisine is sometimes influenced by more dedicated royal cuisine. Tastes and looks of food in Bangkok have changed somewhat over time as they have been influenced by other cuisines such as Asian, European or Western countries. 
 Central Thai : cuisine of the flat and wet central  rice-growing  plains, site of the former Thai kingdoms of  Sukhothai  and  Ayutthaya , and the  Dvaravati  culture of the  Mon people  from before the arrival of  Siamese  in the area.  Coconut milk  is one of major ingredients used in Central Thai cuisine. 
 Lao cuisine  or  Northeastern Thai : cuisine of the more arid  Khorat Plateau , influenced by the  culture of Laos  and also by  Khmer cuisine . 
 Northern Thai : cuisine of the cooler valleys and forested mountains of the  Thai highlands , once ruled by the former  Lanna Kingdom  and home of  Lannaese , the majority of  northern Thailand . This cuisine shares many ingredients with Isan. 
 Southern Thai : cuisine of the  Kra Isthmus  which is bordered on two sides by tropical seas, with its many islands and including the  ethnic Malay , former  Sultanate of Pattani  in the deep south. The complex curries, food preparation techniques and usage of chillies and spices in Southern Thai cuisine form a great influence on the whole cuisine in general. 
 Royal cuisine [ edit ] 
   Kaeng phet pet yang , a legacy of the palace cuisine of Ayutthaya 
 In addition to these regional cuisines, there is also Thai royal cuisine which can trace its history back to the  cosmopolitan  palace cuisine of the  Ayutthaya kingdom  (1351–1767 CE). Its refinement, cooking techniques, presentation, and use of ingredients were of great influence to the cuisine of the central Thai plains. [11] [12] [13]  Thai royal cuisine has been influenced by the Khmer royal cuisine through the Khmer palace  cooks  brought to the Ayutthaya Kingdom during its conquests of the  Khmer Empire . [14] [15]  Thai royal cuisine has become very well known from the  Rattanakosin Era  onwards.
 Typically, Thai royal cuisine has basic characteristics that are close to the basic food prepared by general people. However, Thai royal cuisine focuses on the freshness of seasonal products. Other than that, it is crucial that the way in which Thai royal food is cooked, should be complex and delicate.
 La Loubère, an envoy from France during the reign of  King Narai , recorded that the food at the court was generally similar to villager food. What makes Thai Royal cuisine different food is its beautiful presentation. For example, they served fish and chicken with the bones removed, and the vegetables were served in bite-sized portions. In addition, if beef is used, it should be tenderloin only.
 There are many types of Thai royal cuisine such as  ranchuan  curry,  nam phrik long ruea ,  matsaman  curry, rice in jasmine-flavored iced water or  khao chae , spicy salad, fruit, and carved vegetable.
 Thai chef  McDang , himself descended from the royal family, asserts that the difference between royal Thai cuisine and regular Thai cuisine is fiction. He maintains that the only difference between the food of the palace and that of the common people is the former's elaborate presentation and better ingredients. [16] [17] 
 
 Serving [ edit ] 
   Phat thai kung , from  Bangkok 
   A typical family meal on the floor  mat  in  Isan  region 
 Thai food was traditionally eaten with the hand [18] [19]  while seated on mats or carpets on the floor or coffee table in upper middle class families, customs still found in more traditional households. Today, however, most Thais eat with a fork and spoon. Tables and chairs were introduced as part of a broader  Westernization  drive during the reign of  King Mongkut , Rama IV. The fork and spoon were introduced by  King Chulalongkorn  after his return from a tour of Europe in 1897 CE. [20] 
 Important to Thai dining is the practice of   khluk , mixing the flavors and textures of different dishes with the rice from one's plate. The food is pushed by the fork, held in the left hand, into the spoon held in the right hand, which is then brought to the mouth. [21]  A traditional ceramic spoon is sometimes used for soup, and knives are not generally used at the table. [22]  It is common practice for both the Thais and the  hill tribe peoples  who live in  Lanna  and  Isan  to use sticky rice as an edible implement by shaping it into small, and sometimes flattened, balls by hand (and only the right hand by custom) which are then dipped into side dishes and eaten.
 
   Thai meal in a village temple 
 Chopsticks  were foreign utensils to most  ethnic groups in Thailand  with the exception of the  Thai Chinese , and a few other cultures such as the  Akha people , who are recent arrivals from  Yunnan  Province,  China . Traditionally, the majority of ethnic  Thai people  ate with their hands like the people of India. Chopsticks are mainly used in Thailand for eating Chinese-style noodle soups, or at  Chinese ,  Japanese , or  Korean restaurants . Stir-fried noodle dishes such as  drunken noodles ,  pad see ew , and  pad thai , and curry-noodle dishes such as  khanom chin  nam ngiao , are also eaten with a fork and spoon in the Thai fashion.
 Thai meals typically consist of rice ( khao  in Thai) with many complementary dishes shared by all. The dishes are all served at the same time, including the soups, and it is also customary to provide more dishes than there are guests at a table. A Thai family meal would normally consist of rice with several dishes which should form a harmonious contrast of flavors and textures as well as preparation methods. Traditionally, a meal would have at least five elements: a dip or relish for raw or cooked vegetables ( khrueang chim ) is the most crucial component of any Thai meal. [23] [24]   Khrueang chim , considered a building block of Thai food by Chef McDang, may come in the form of a spicy  chili sauce or relish  called  nam phrik  (made of raw or cooked chilies and other ingredients, which are then mashed together), or a type of dip enriched with coconut milk called  lon . The other elements would include a clear soup (perhaps a spicy  tom yam  or a mellow  tom chuet ), a curry or stew (essentially any dish identified with the  kaeng  prefix), a deep-fried dish, and a stir-fried dish of meat, fish, seafood, or vegetables.
 
   A plate of raw vegetables and herbs, together with  nam phrik  kapi , is often served as a complimentary dish at  southern Thai  eateries. 
 In most Thai restaurants, diners will have access to a selection of Thai sauces ( nam chim ) and condiments, either brought to the table by wait staff or present at the table in small containers. These may include  phrik nam pla/nam pla phrik  (fish sauce, lime juice, chopped chilies and garlic), dried chili flakes,  sweet chili sauce , sliced chili peppers in rice vinegar,  Sriracha sauce , and even sugar. With certain dishes, such as  khao kha mu  (pork trotter stewed in soy sauce and served with rice), whole  Thai peppers  and raw  garlic  are served in addition to the sour chili sauce. Cucumber is sometimes eaten to cool the mouth with particularly spicy dishes. They often feature as a  garnish , especially with one-dish meals. The plain rice, sticky rice or the  khanom chin  (Thai rice noodles) served alongside a spicy  Thai curry  or stir-fry, tends to counteract the spiciness.
 When time is limited or when eating alone, single dishes, such as fried rice or noodle soups, are quick and filling. An alternative is to have one or more smaller helpings of curry, stir fries and other dishes served together on one plate with a portion of rice. This style of serving food is called  khao rat kaeng  (lit., "rice covered with curry"), or for short  khao kaeng  (lit., "rice curry"). Eateries and shops that specialize in pre-made food are the usual place to go to for having a meal this way. These venues have a large display showing the different dishes one can choose. When placing an order at these places, Thais will state if they want the food served as separate dishes or together on one plate with rice ( rat khao ). Very often, regular restaurants will also feature a selection of freshly made "rice curry" dishes on their menu for single customers.
 
 Ingredients [ edit ]

 Thai cuisine, as a whole, features many different ingredients ( suan phasom ;  Thai :  ส่วนผสม ), and ways of preparing food. Thai chef  McDang  characterises Thai food as having "intricacy, attention to detail, texture, color, and taste. [22] 
 Thai food is known for its enthusiastic use of fresh (rather than dried)  herbs  and  spices . Common flavors in Thai food come from garlic,  galangal ,  coriander /cilantro,  lemongrass ,  shallots ,  pepper ,  kaffir lime  leaves,  shrimp paste ,  fish sauce , and  chilies .  Palm sugar , made from the sap of certain  Borassus  palms, is used to sweeten dishes while  lime  and  tamarind  contribute sour notes. Meats used in Thai cuisine are usually pork and chicken, and also duck,  beef , and  water buffalo . Goat, lamb, and mutton are rarely eaten except by  Muslim Thais  in  Southern Thailand .  Game , such as  wild boar ,  deer  and wild birds, are now less common due to  loss of habitat , the introduction of modern methods of  intensive animal farming  in the 1960s, and the rise of  agribusinesses , such as Thai  Charoen Pokphand Foods , in the 1980s. [25]  Traditionally, fish, crustaceans, and shellfish play an important role in the diet of Thai people. In 2006 the per capita consumption of fish was 33.6 kg. [26] [27]   Anna Leonowens  (of  The King and I  fame) observed in her book  The English Governess at the Siamese Court  (1870): [28] 
 
 
"The stream is rich in fish of excellent quality and flavour, such as is found in most of the great rivers of Asia; and is especially noted for its  platoo , a kind of sardine, so abundant and cheap that it forms a common seasoning to the labourer's bowl of rice." 
 Freshwater varieties come from the many rivers, lakes, ponds, and  paddy fields  inland, and seafood from the tropical seas of the southern half of the country. Some species, such as the  giant river prawn , need brackish water as juveniles but live out their lives in freshwater once mature.  Aquaculture  of species such as  Nile tilapia ,  catfish ,  tiger prawns , and  blood cockles , now generates a large portion of the seafood sold in, and exported from Thailand. [29] 
 
 Rice, noodles and starches [ edit ] 
   Khanom chin , freshly made Thai rice noodles 
 Like most other Asian cuisines, rice is the staple grain of Thai cuisine. According to Thai food expert McDang, rice is the first and most important part of any meal, and the words for rice and food are the same:  khao . As in many other rice eating cultures, to say "eat rice" (in Thai  "kin khao" ,  pronounced  [kīn kʰâːw] ) means to eat food.
Rice is such an integral part of the diet that a common Thai greeting is  "kin khao rue yang?"  which literally translates as "Have you eaten rice yet?". [30] 
 Thai farmers historically have cultivated tens of thousands of rice varieties. The traditional recipe for a rice dish could include as many as 30 varieties of rice. [31]  That number has been drastically reduced due to genetic modifications.
 Non-glutinous rice ( Oryza sativa ) is called  khao chao  (lit., "royal rice"). One type, which is indigenous to Thailand, is the highly prized, sweet-smelling  jasmine rice  ( khao hom mali ). This naturally aromatic long-grained rice grows in abundance in the  patchwork of paddy fields  that blanket Thailand's central plains. Once the  rice is steamed  or cooked, it is called  khao suai  (lit., "beautiful rice"). Non-glutinous rice is used for making fried rice dishes, and for  congee , of which there are three main varieties:  khao tom  (a thin rice soup, most often with minced pork or fish),  khao tom kui  (a thick, unflavored rice porridge that is served with side dishes), or  chok  (a thick rice porridge that is flavored with broth and minced meat).
 
   Som tam, grilled chicken and  sticky rice  is a popular combination. 
 Other varieties of rice eaten in Thailand include:  sticky rice  ( khao niao ), a unique variety of rice which contains an unusual balance of the starches present in all rice, causing it to cook up to a sticky texture. Thai  Red Cargo rice , an unpolished long grain rice with an outer deep reddish-brown color and a white center, has a nutty taste and slightly chewy compared to the soft and gummy texture of jasmine rice. Only the husks of the red rice grains are removed which allows it to retain all its nutrients and vitamins, but unlike brown rice, its red color comes from antioxidants in the bran. Black sticky rice is a type of sticky rice with a deep purple-red color that may appear black. Another unpolished grain, black sticky rice has a rich nutty flavor that is most often used in desserts.
 Noodles in Thailand are usually made from the flour of rice, wheat, or mung bean. Perhaps one of the oldest type of noodle in Thailand is  khanom chin , which is a fresh type of rice vermicelli made from fermented rice, and eaten with toppings like  green curry  ( kaeng khiao wan ) with chicken or in  green papaya salad  ( som tam ). Other noodle varieties were subsequently introduced by Chinese migrants to Thailand, as is testified by their Sino-Thai name  kuaitiao  (ก๋วยเตี๋ยว; Chinese: 粿條; pinyin: gǔotiáo). The three most common rice varieties of  kuaitiao  are  sen yai  (เส้นใหญ่) wide flat noodles,  sen lek  (เส้นเล็ก) narrow flat noodles, and  sen mi  (เส้นหมี่; or  rice vermicelli ), which are round and thin. A fourth popular variety,  bami  (บะหมี่; Chinese: 薄麵; pinyin: báomiàn) is made from egg and  wheat  flour and is usually sold fresh.  Bami  are similar to the Teochew  mee pok . A fifth type,  wun sen  (วุ้นเส้น; lit. "jelly strands"), called  cellophane noodles  or  glass noodles  in English, are thin round noodles made from  mung bean  flour which are sold dried. Lastly, and least common in noodle shops, are " silver needle noodles "  kiam-i  (เกี้ยมอี๋), a somewhat thick round rice noodle similar in size and shape to bean sprouts. Thai noodle dishes, whether stir fried like  pad thai  or in the form of a noodle soup, usually come as an individual serving and are not meant to be shared and eaten communally.
 Rice flour ( paeng khao chao ) and  tapioca  flour ( paeng man sampalang ) are often used in desserts or as thickening agents.
 
 Pastes and sauces [ edit ] 
   Nam pla phrik , a table sauce most often eaten with rice dishes, is made from fish sauce and sliced chilies, and often also includes garlic and lime. 
 An ingredient found in many Thai dishes and used in every region of the country is  nam pla , a clear  fish sauce  that is very aromatic. Fish sauce is a staple ingredient in Thai cuisine and imparts a unique character to Thai food. Fish sauce is prepared with fermented fish that is made into a fragrant condiment and provides a salty flavor. There are many varieties of fish sauce and many variations in the way it is prepared. Some fish may be fermented with shrimp or spices. Another type of sauce made from fermented fish is  pla ra . It is more pungent than  nam pla , and, in contrast to  nam pla , which is a clear liquid,  pla ra  is opaque and often contains pieces of fish. To add this sauce to a  som tam  (spicy papaya salad) is a matter of choice.  Kapi , Thai  shrimp paste , is a combination of fermented ground shrimp and salt. It is used in the famous chili paste called  nam phrik kapi , in rice dishes such as  khao khluk kapi  and it is indispensable for making  Thai curry  pastes.  Tai pla  is a pungent sauce used in the  southern Thai  cuisine, that is made from the fermented innards of the  short mackerel  ( pla thu ). [32]  It is one of the main condiments of  kaeng tai pla  curry and is also used to make  nam phrik tai pla . [33]  Far removed from the nearest sea, from northern Thailand comes  nam pu , a thick, black paste made by boiling mashed  rice-paddy crabs  for hours. It is used as an ingredient for certain northern Thai salads, curries, and chili pastes. It too has a strong and pungent flavor. [34] 
 
   Nam phrik  pla chi  (a chili paste from northern Thailand made with grilled fish) is served here with raw and steamed vegetables as one of the dishes in a communal meal. 
   Nam phrik long ruea . 
 Nam phrik  are Thai chili pastes, similar to the  Indonesian  and  Malaysian   sambals . Each region has its own special versions. The words  "nam phrik"  are used by Thais to describe many pastes containing chilies used for dipping, although the more watery versions tend to be called  nam chim .  Thai curry  pastes are normally called  phrik kaeng  or  khrueang kaeng  (lit. curry ingredients), but some people also use the word  nam phrik  to designate a curry paste. Red curry paste, for instance, could be called  phrik kaeng phet  or  khrueang kaeng phet  in Thai, but also  nam phrik kaeng phet . Both  nam phrik  and  phrik kaeng  are prepared by crushing together chilies with various ingredients such as garlic and shrimp paste using a  mortar and pestle . Some  nam phrik  are served as a dip with vegetables such as cucumbers, cabbage and yard-long beans, either raw or blanched. One such paste is  nam phrik num , a paste of pounded fresh green chilies, shallots, garlic and coriander leaves. The sweet roasted chili paste called  nam phrik phao  is often used as an ingredient in  tom yam  or when frying meat or seafood, and it is also popular as a spicy "jam" on bread, or served as a dip with  prawn crackers . The dry  nam phrik kung , made with pounded  dried shrimp  ( kung haeng ), is often eaten plain with rice and a few slices of cucumber. French diplomat  Simon de la Loubère  observed that chili pastes were vital for the way Thai people eat. He provides us with a recipe for  nam phrik  with  pla ra  and onions in  Du Royaume de Siam , an account of his mission to Thailand published in 1691. [35] 
 The soy sauces which are used in Thai cuisine are of Chinese origin, and the Thai names for them are (wholly or partially)  loanwords  from the  Teochew dialect :  si-io dam  (black soy sauce),  si-io khao  (light soy sauce),  si-io wan  (sweet soy sauce), and  taochiao  (fermented whole soy beans).  Namman hoi  ( oyster sauce ) is also of Chinese origin. It is used extensively in vegetable and meat stir fries.
 Satay  is also common in Thailand, grilled or skewered meat served with a spicy peanut dipping sauce made from roasted or fried peanuts.
 
 Vegetables, herbs and spices [ edit ] 
   A vegetable stall,  Chiang Mai 
   At southern Thai restaurants most often a vegetable and herbs platter with  nam phrik kapi  is served as a complementary dish 
 Thai dishes use a wide variety of herbs, spices and leaves rarely found in the West. The characteristic flavor of  kaffir lime  leaves ( bai makrut ) appears in many Thai soups (e.g., the hot and sour  tom yam ) or curry from the southern and central areas of Thailand. The Thai  lime  ( manao ) is smaller, darker and sweeter than the kaffir lime, which has a rough looking skin with a stronger lime flavor. Kaffir lime leaves or rind is frequently combined with  galangal  ( kha ) and  lemongrass  ( takhrai ), either kept whole in simmered dishes or blended together with liberal amounts of chilies and other aromatics to make curry paste. Fresh  Thai basil , distinctively redolent of  cloves , and with stems which are often tinged with a purple color, are used to add fragrance in certain dishes such as  green curry . Other commonly used herbs in Thai cuisine include  phak chi , ( coriander  or cilantro leaves),  rak phak chi  (cilantro/coriander roots),  spearmint  ( saranae ),  holy basil  ( kaphrao ), ginger ( khing ),  turmeric  ( khamin ),  fingerroot  ( krachai ),  culantro  ( phak chi farang ),  pandanus  leaves ( bai toei ), and  Thai lemon basil  ( maenglak ). Spices and spice mixtures used in Thai cuisine include  phong phalo  ( five-spice powder ),  phong kari  ( curry powder ), and fresh and dried  peppercorns  ( phrik thai ). Northern Thai  larb  uses a very elaborate spice mix, called  phrik lap , which includes ingredients such as  cumin ,  cloves ,  long pepper ,  star anise ,  prickly ash seeds  and  cinnamon . [36]

 Besides kaffir lime leaves, several other tree leaves are used in Thai cuisine such as  cha-om , the young feathery leaves of the  Acacia pennata  tree. These leaves can be cooked in omelettes, soups and curries or eaten raw in northern Thai salads.  Banana leaves  are often used as packaging for ready-made food or as steamer cups such as in  ho mok  pla , a spicy steamed  pâté  or  soufflé  made with fish and coconut milk.  Banana  flowers are also used in  Thai salads  or as a vegetable ingredient for certain curries. The leaves and flowers of the  neem tree  ( sadao ) are also eaten blanched.  Phak lueat  (leaves from the  Ficus virens ) are cooked in curries, and  bai makok  (from the  Spondias mombin ) can be eaten raw with a chili paste.
 Five main chilies are generally used as ingredients in Thai food. One chili is very small (about 1.25 centimetres (0.49 in)) and is known as the hottest chili:  phrik khi nu suan  ("garden mouse-dropping chili"). The slightly larger chili  phrik khi nu  ("mouse-dropping chili") is the next hottest. The green or red  phrik chi fa  ("sky pointing chili") is slightly less spicy than the smaller chilies. The very large   phrik yuak , which is pale green in color, is the least spicy and used more as a vegetable. Lastly, the dried chilies:  phrik haeng  are spicier than the two largest chilies and dried to a dark red color.

 Other typical ingredients are the several types of  eggplant  ( makhuea ) used in Thai cuisine, such as the pea-sized  makhuea phuang  and the egg-sized  makhuea suai , often also eaten raw. Although  broccoli  is often used in Asian restaurants in the west in  phat phak ruam  (stir fried mixed vegetables) and  rat na  (rice noodles served in gravy), it was never used in any traditional Thai food in Thailand and was rarely seen in Thailand. Usually in Thailand,  khana  is used, for which broccoli is a substitute. Other vegetables which are often eaten in Thailand are  thua fak yao  ( yardlong beans ),  thua ngok  ( bean sprouts ),  no mai  ( bamboo shoots ), tomatoes,  cucumbers ,  phak tam lueng  ( Coccinia grandis ),  phak kha na  ( Chinese kale ),  phak kwangtung  ( choy sum ),  sweet potatoes  (both the tuber and leaves), a few types of  squash ,  phak krathin  ( Leucaena leucocephala ),  sato  ( Parkia speciosa ),  tua phū  ( winged beans ) and  khaophot  ( corn ).
 Among the green, leafy vegetables and herbs that are usually eaten raw in a meal or as a side dish in Thailand, the most important are:  phak bung  ( morning glory ),  horapha  ( Thai basil ),  bai bua bok  ( Asian pennywort ),  phak kachet  ( water mimosa ),  phak kat khao  ( Chinese cabbage ),  phak phai  ( praew leaves ),  phak kayang  ( rice paddy herb ),  phak chi farang  ( culantro ),  phak tiu  ( Cratoxylum formosum ),  phak "phaai"  ( yellow burr head ) and  kalamplī  ( cabbage ). [37]  Some of these leaves are highly perishable and must be used within a couple of days.
 Several types of  mushroom  ( het ) also feature in Thai cuisine such as  straw mushrooms  ( het fang ),  shiitake  ( het hom ), and  white jelly fungus  ( het hu nu khao ). [38] 
 Flowers are also commonly used ingredients in many Thai dishes, either as a vegetable, such as  dok khae  ( Sesbania grandiflora ) and  huapli  (the flower bud of the  banana ), or as a food coloring, such as with the blue-colored  dok anchan  (the flowers of the  Clitoria ternatea , which can also be eaten raw or fried).
 
 Fruits [ edit ] 
   Durians at a Thai market 
 Fresh fruit forms a large part of the Thai diet, and are customarily served after a meal as dessert. The Scottish author  John Crawfurd , sent on an embassy to Bangkok in 1822, writes in his account of the journey:
 "The fruits of Siam, or at least of the neighbourhood of Bangkok, are excellent and various, surpassing, according to the experience of our party (...) those of all other parts of India." [39]  The Siamese themselves consume great quantities of fruit, and the whole neighbourhood of Bangkok is one forest of fruit trees. [40] 
 Fruit is not only eaten on its own, but often served with spicy dips made from sugar, salt, and chilies. [41]  Fruits feature in spicy salads such as  som tam  (green papaya salad) and  yam som-o  (pomelo salad), in soups with  tamarind juice  such as  tom khlong  and  kaeng som , and in Thai curries such as  kaeng khanun  (jackfruit curry),  kaeng phet pet yang  (grilled duck curry with pineapple or grapes), and  kaeng pla sapparot  (fish and pineapple curry). Fruits are also used in certain Thai chili pastes, such as in  nam phrik long rue  made with   madan  (a close relative of the  mangosteen ), [42]  and  nam phrik luk namliap , salted black  Chinese olive  chilli paste. [43] 
 Although many of the exotic fruits of Thailand may have been sometimes unavailable in Western countries, Asian markets now import such fruits as  rambutan  and  lychees . In Thailand one can find  papaya ,  jackfruit ,  mango ,  mangosteen ,  langsat ,  longan ,  pomelo ,  pineapple ,  rose apples ,  durian ,  Burmese grapes  and other native fruits.  Chanthaburi  in Thailand each year holds the  World Durian Festival  in early May. This single province is responsible for half of the durian production of Thailand and a quarter of the world production. [44] [45] [46]  The  Langsat Festival  is held each year in  Uttaradit  on weekends in September. The  langsat  ( Lansium parasiticum ), for which Uttaradit is famous, is a fruit that is similar in taste to the  longan . [47] 
 
   Kaeng kanun , a northern Thai curry made with jackfruit 
 From the  coconut  comes  coconut milk , used both in curries and desserts, and  coconut oil . [48]  The  juice of a green coconut  can be served as a drink and the young flesh is eaten in either sweet or savory dishes. The grated flesh of a mature coconut is used raw or toasted in sweets, salads and snacks such as  miang kham . [49]  Thais not only consume products derived from the nut (actually a  drupe ), but they also make use of the  growth bud of the palm tree  as a vegetable. From the stalk of the flowers comes a sap that can be used to make  coconut vinegar , alcoholic beverages, and sugar. Coconut milk and other coconut-derived ingredients feature heavily in the cuisines of central and southern Thailand. In contrast to these regions, coconut palms do not grow as well in northern and northeastern Thailand, where in wintertime the temperatures are lower and where there is a dry season that can last five to six months. In northern Thai cuisine, only a few dishes, most notably the noodle soup  khao soi , use coconut milk. In the southern parts of northeastern Thailand, where the region borders  Cambodia , one can again find dishes containing coconut. It is also here that the people eat non-glutinous rice, just as in central and southern Thailand, and not glutinous rice as they do in northern Thailand and in the rest of northeastern Thailand. [50] 
 Apples ,  pears ,  peaches ,  grapes , and  strawberries , which do not traditionally grow in Thailand and in the past had to be imported, have become increasingly popular in the last few decades since they were introduced to Thai farmers by the Thai Royal Projects, starting in 1969, and the  Doi Tung  Project since 1988. These temperate fruit grow especially well in the cooler, northern  Thai highlands , where they were initially introduced as a  replacement for the cultivation of opium , together with other crops such as cabbages,  tea , and  arabica coffee .
 
 Food controversies [ edit ] 
 Agricultural chemicals [ edit ] 
   Kung phao , grilled prawns, made with the  giant river prawns  that are native to the rivers of central Thailand 
 According to the Thai government's  The Eleventh National Economic and Social Development Plan (2012–2016) , Thailand is number one in the world in the application of chemicals in agriculture. The report stated that, "The use of chemicals in the agricultural and industrial sectors is growing while control mechanisms are ineffective making Thailand rank first in the world in the use of registered chemicals in agriculture." [51] : 111  
 The Thai Pesticide Alert Network (ThaiPAN), a food safety advocacy group, annually tests Thai farm produce for contamination. In their June 2019 report, the group found that of 286 samples, 41% of produce was found to contain unsafe levels of chemicals. [52]  The group surveyed both wet markets and retail stores across the nation. Contaminants were found in 44% of samples from retail stores, and 39% of samples from wet markets. Vegetables with the highest levels of contamination were Chinese mustard greens, kale, hot basil, parsley, chilis, and cauliflower. Fruits with the highest contamination were tangerines, rose apples, guavas, and grapes. Contamination levels decreased from 2018, when 46% of samples were found to be contaminated, and 2016, when more than 50% of tested produce was found to be unsafe. [53] 
 In prior years, "Q-Mark" goods showed a higher prevalence of contamination, 61.5%, than they did during ThaiPAN's March 2016 survey, 57%. Q-Mark is Thailand's National Bureau of Agricultural Commodity and Food Standards (ACFS) mark of quality. [54] [55] 
 In a survey of hydroponically-grown vegetables, ThaiPAN, in late-2017, tested 30  hydroponic  vegetables purchased at Thai fresh markets and supermarkets. Of 30 vegetables tested, 19 contained noxious chemical levels above maximum limits. Three samples were contaminated, but at levels below the legal maximum. Eight samples were free of harmful chemicals. [56] 
 On 22 October 2019, the 26-member National Hazardous Substances Committee (NHSC) changed  paraquat ,  glyphosate , and  chlorpyrifos  from Type 3 toxic substances to Type 4, effectively prohibiting their production, import, export, or possession. Their use will be prohibited as of 1 December 2019. [57]  On 27 November 2019, the NHSC amended that timetable, moving the date for the ban of paraquat and chlorpyrifos to 1 June 2020. They lifted the ban on glyphosate with restrictions on usage: glyphosate will be used only on six major crops: corn, cassava, sugarcane, rubber, oil palms, and fruit. It is not permitted in watershed areas and other sensitive environment zones, and farmers must submit proof of use including the type of crops and the size of their farms when purchasing glyphosate. Industry Minister  Suriya Jungrungreangkit , who chairs the NHSC, said the committee reached its decision after reviewing information provided by the Department of Agriculture and the Ministry of Public Health. [58]  NCHS member Jirapon Limpananon, chair of the Pharmacy Council of Thailand, announced her resignation from the NCHS Wednesday night following the meeting. [59] [60] 
 
 Misrepresentation [ edit ] 
 In September 2016 a shipment of pork labelled " halal "—a permissible food for Muslims—was delivered to a hotel in  Krabi Province . The Central Islamic Committee of Thailand (CICOT) denounced the use of a halal-certified logo on pork, saying it will take legal action against people responsible. The committee found the halal label to be fake. Under Thai laws, CICOT is responsible for certifying halal products. [61] 
 A survey of the quality of  fish sauce  sold across Thailand reported that just over one-third of the samples were not up to standards set by the  Public Health Ministry . The three-year survey, from 2012 to 2015, involved 1,121 samples of fish sauce sold under 422 brands from 245 manufacturers. Of the total analysed, 410 samples, or 36.5 percent, did not meet the standard. The major reasons for the substandard fish sauce were low  nitrogen  readings and the ratio of  glutamic acid  to nitrogen either higher or lower than the required standards. [62] 
 Representative dishes [ edit ]

 Whereas many Thai dishes are now familiar in the West, the vast majority are not. In many of the dishes below, different kinds of protein, or combinations of protein, are interchangeable as the main ingredient. Beef ( nuea ), chicken ( kai ), pork ( mu ), duck ( pet ),  tofu  ( taohu ), fish ( pla ), prawns or shrimp ( kung ), crab ( pu ),  shellfish  ( hoi ), or  egg  ( khai ) can, for example, all be used as main ingredients for  kaeng phet  (red curry). Thus  kaeng phet kai  is red curry with chicken and  kaeng phet mu  is red curry made with pork.
 
 Breakfast dishes [ edit ] 
 Khao chao  ( Thai :  ข้าวเช้า ; lit. "morning rice/food"), breakfast dishes, for Thais are limited. Very often, a Thai breakfast can consist of the same dishes with rice which are also eaten for lunch or dinner. Single dishes such as fried rice, noodle soups, and steamed rice with something simple such as an omelette, fried/grilled pork or chicken, or a stir fry with vegetables, are commonly sold for breakfast from  street stalls  as a quick  take-out .
 The following dishes are viewed as being specific breakfast dishes but they can also be found at any other moment of the day: [63] [64] 
 
 Chok  – a rice porridge commonly eaten in Thailand for breakfast. Similar to the  rice congee  eaten in other parts of Asia.

 Ice cream [ edit ] 
   Ice cream with  thapthim krop , Bangkok 
 Ice cream was introduced to Thailand during the reign of  King Rama V  when the first ice cream machine was imported to Thailand. [70]  Ice cream in the second half of the 19th century was made of coconut water blended with ice. At first, ice could not be produced in Thailand. That led to importing ice from Singapore. Ice cream was then an upper-class treat, but over time ice cream became more widely available and the product was improved by replacing coconut water with coconut milk.
 There were two types of ice cream in Thailand. First, ice cream in the palace was made of coconut juice with roasted tamarind on top. Second, ice cream for the public was coconut ice cream with the scent of the Nommaeo flower with a slight sweet taste. The ice cream "tube" was born during the reign of  Rama VII . Its ingredients were contained inside a zinc tube which was shaken until it solidified, then skewered stick to serve as a handle. It was sold by mobile vendors using dry ice and salt to keep the ice cream cold. Eventually, ice cream was manufactured and sold in small cups. [71] 
 According to the  Bangkok Post ,  aitim tat  ( Thai :  ไอติม ตัด ; "cut ice cream"), was very popular 30 years ago (1986). It came in rectangular bars of various flavors, sliced into pieces by the vendor, who then inserted two wooden sticks into the pieces to use as holders.  Aitim tat  was made from milk, coconut milk, flour, sugar, and artificial flavour. The price was one or two  baht , depending on the size. [70] 
 The Pop Company in the 1970s set up the first ice-cream manufacturing plant in Thailand. The company used a duck logo, resulting it the nickname  aitim tra pet  ( Thai :  ไอติม ตรา เป็ด ; "duck brand ice cream"). [70]  It was sold in front of Chaloemchai Theater. Its most popular offering was called "banana split", with three flavors of ice cream, chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry. [71]

 Insects [ edit ] 
 See also:  List of edible insects by country 
   A street stall selling fried insects 
 Edible insects , whole or in chili paste and as ingredients in fortified products, are common in Thailand. Some claim that Thailand is the world leader in edible insects. [72]  The UN  Food and Agriculture Organization  (FAO) estimates that there are about 20,000  cricket  farms alone in 53 of Thailand's 76 provinces. [73] 
 A wide range of  insects are eaten  in Thailand, especially in Isan and in the north. Many markets in Thailand sell deep-fried  grasshoppers , crickets ( ching-rit ),  bee larvae ,  silkworm  ( non mai ),  ant eggs  ( khai mot ) and  termites . The culinary creativity even extends to naming: one tasty larva, which is also known under the name "bamboo worm" ( non mai phai ,  Omphisa fuscidentalis ), [74]  is colloquially called "express train" ( rot duan ) due to its appearance.
 Most insects reportedly taste fairly bland when deep-fried. In contrast to the bland taste of most of these insects, the  maeng da  or  maelong da na  ( Lethocerus indicus ) has been described as having a very penetrating taste, similar to that of a very ripe  gorgonzola cheese . [75]  This  giant water bug  is famously used in a chili dip called  nam phrik maeng da . [76]  Ant eggs and silkworms are eaten boiled in a soup in  Isan , or used in egg dishes in northern Thailand. [77] 
 
 Street food, food courts, and market food [ edit ]

 Main article:  Street food of Thailand 
 The street food culture of Southeast Asia was introduced by  coolie  workers imported from China during the late 19th century. As a result, many Thai street foods are derived from or heavily influenced by  Chinese cuisine . [78]  Street food was commonly sold by the  ethnic Chinese population of Thailand  and did not become popular among native Thai people until the early 1960s, when the rapid urban population growth stimulated the street food culture, [79]  and by the 1970s, it had "displaced home-cooking." [80] 
 The quality and choice of street food in Thailand is world-renowned. Bangkok is often mentioned as one of the best street food cities in the world, and even called the street food capital of the world. [81] [82]  The website  VirtualTourist  says: "Few places in the world, if any, are as synonymous with street food as Thailand. For the variety of locations and abundance of options, we selected Bangkok, Thailand, as our number one spot for street food. Bangkok is notable for both its variety of offerings and the city's abundance of street hawkers." [83] 
 There is scarcely a Thai dish that is not sold by a street vendor or at a market somewhere in Thailand. Some specialize in only one or two dishes; others offer a complete menu that rival that of restaurants. Some sell only pre-cooked foods, while others make food to order. Foods that are made to order tend to be dishes that can be quickly prepared: quick stir fries with rice, such as  phat kaphrao  (spicy basil-fried minced pork, chicken, or seafood) [84]  or  phat khana  (stir fried  gailan ) and quick curries such as  pladuk phat phet  (catfish fried with red curry paste).

 Noodles are a popular street food item as they are mainly eaten as a single dish. Chinese-style noodle soups, fried noodles, and fermented Thai rice noodles ( khanom chin ), served with a choice of different Thai curries, are popular. Nearly everywhere in Thailand, you will see  som tam  ( green papaya salad ) and sticky rice sold at stalls and roadside shops. This is popularly eaten together with grilled chicken, but if the shop does not sell any themselves, someone else nearby will. In most cities and towns there will be stalls selling sweet  roti , a thin, flat fried dough envelope, with fillings such as banana, egg, and chocolate. The  roti  is similar to the Malay  roti canai  and Singaporean  roti prata , and the stalls are often operated by  Thai Muslims . Sweets snacks, collectively called  khanom , such as  tako  (coconut cream jelly),  khanom man  (coconut  cassava  cake), and  khanom wun  (flavored jellies), can be seen displayed on large trays in glass covered push-carts. Other sweets, such as  khanom bueang  and  khanom khrok  (somewhat similar to Dutch  poffertjes ), are made to order.
 In the evenings, mobile street stalls, often only a scooter with a side car, drive by and temporarily set up shop outside bars in Thailand, selling  kap klaem  ("drinking food"). Popular  kap klaem  dishes sold by mobile vendors are grilled items such as sun-dried squid, meats on skewers, or grilled sour sausages, and deep-fried snacks such as fried insects or fried sausages. Peeled and sliced fruits are also sold from street carts, laid out on a bed of crushed ice to preserve their freshness.  Salapao , steamed buns filled with meat or sweet beans and the Thai version of the Chinese steamed  baozi , are also commonly sold by mobile vendors.

 Food markets in Thailand, large open air halls with permanent stalls, tend to operate as a collection of street stalls, each vendor with their own set of tables and providing (limited) service, although some resemble the regular food courts at shopping malls and large supermarkets, with service counters and the communal use of tables. Food courts and food markets offer many of the same foods as street stalls, both pre-cooked as well as made to order. Night food markets, in the form of a collection of street stalls and mobile vendors, spring up in parking lots, along busy streets, and at temple fairs and local festivals in the evenings, when the temperatures are more agreeable and people have finished work.
 The dishes sold at  wet markets  in Thailand tend to be offered pre-cooked. Many people go there, and also to street vendors, to buy food for at work, or to take back home. It is a common sight to see Thais carrying whole communal meals consisting of several dishes, cooked rice, sweets, and fruit, all neatly packaged in plastic bags and  foam food containers , to be shared with colleagues at work or at home with friends and family. Due to the fact that many dishes are similar to those that people would cook at home, it is a good place to find regional, and seasonal, foods.
 
 Vegetarianism in Thailand [ edit ] 
 Traditional Thai vegetarian restaurants will carry yellow signs with  che  ( Thai :  เจ ) (left) or  ahan che  ( Thai :  อาหาร เจ ) (right) written in red in  Thai script . 
 Although the  Vegetarian Festival  is celebrated each year by a portion of Thailand's population, and many restaurants in Thailand will offer vegetarian food during this festival period, pure vegetarian food is usually difficult to find in normal restaurants and eateries in Thailand. All traditionally made  Thai curries , for instance, contain  shrimp paste , and  fish sauce  is used as salt in many Thai dishes. At shops and restaurants that specifically cater to vegetarians, substitutes for these ingredients are used. Meat dishes are also commonly part of the  alms  offered to  Buddhist monks in Thailand , as  vegetarianism  is not considered obligatory in  Theravada  Buddhism, but having an animal killed specifically to feed Buddhist monks is prohibited. [85] [86]

 In most towns and cities, traditional  Buddhist vegetarian fare , without any meat or seafood products of any kind and also excluding certain strong tasting vegetables and spices, is sold at specialized vegetarian restaurants which can be recognized by a yellow sign with in Thai script the word  che  ( Thai :  เจ ) or  ahan che  ( Thai :  อาหาร เจ ) written on it in red. These restaurants serve what can be regarded as  vegan  food. Many Indian restaurants of the sizable  Thai-Indian community  will also have vegetarian dishes on offer, due to the fact that vegetarianism is held as an ideal by many  followers of the Hindu faith . Indian vegetarian cuisine can incorporate  dairy products  and  honey . Due to the increased demand for vegetarian food from foreign tourists, many hotels, guesthouses and restaurants that cater to them will now also have vegetarian versions of Thai dishes on their menu.  Pescatarians  would have very few problems with Thai cuisine due to the abundance of Thai dishes which only contain fish and seafood as their source of animal protein. [87] [88] [89] [90] [91] 
 
 Culinary diplomacy [ edit ] 
   A dish of peanuts, ginger, and chili,  Kiin Kiin  (Copenhagen) 
 Thai cuisine only became well-known worldwide from the 1960s on, when  Thailand became a destination for international tourism  and US troops arrived in large numbers during the  Vietnam War . The number of Thai restaurants went up from four in the 1970s  London  to between two and three hundred in less than 25 years. [92] : 3–4   The earliest attested Thai restaurant in the United States, "Chada Thai", opened its doors in 1959 in  Denver , Colorado. It was run by the former newspaper publisher Lai-iad (Lily) Chittivej. The oldest Thai restaurant in London, "The Bangkok Restaurant", was opened in 1967 by Mr and Mrs  Bunnag , a former Thai diplomat and his wife, in  South Kensington . [93] 
 The global popularity of Thai cuisine is seen as an important factor in promoting tourism, and also increased exports of Thailand's  agricultural sector . It is a result of deliberate  "gastrodiplomacy" . In June 2009, the  Tourism Authority of Thailand  organised a conference to discuss these matters at the  Queen Sirikit National Convention Centre  in Bangkok. TAT Governor Seree Wangpaichitr said, "This conference was long overdue. The promotion of Thai cuisine is one of our major niche-market targets. Our figures show that visitors spent 38.8 billion baht on eating and drinking last year, up 16% over 1997." [94] 
 The  Thaksin administration  (2001–2006) launched the "Kitchen of the World" campaign early in its tenure to promote Thai cuisine internationally, with a yearly budget of 500 million  baht . It provided loans and training for  restaurateurs  seeking to establish Thai restaurants overseas; established the "Thai Select" certification program which encouraged the use of ingredients imported from Thailand; and promoted integration between Thai investors,  Thai Airways , and the Tourism Authority of Thailand with Thai restaurants overseas. [92] : 10–12  
 The "Global Thai" program, launched in 2002, was a government-led culinary diplomacy initiative. It aimed to boost the number of Thai restaurants worldwide to 8,000 by 2003 from about 5,500 previously. [95]  By 2011, that number had swelled to more than 10,000 Thai restaurants worldwide. [96] 
 The program was explained in  Thailand: Kitchen of the World , an e-book published to promote the program. The point of the e-book: "In the view of the Export Promotion Department, Thai restaurants have a good business potential that can be developed to maintain a high level of international recognition. To achieve that goal, the department is carrying out a public relations campaign to build up a good image of the country through Thai restaurants worldwide." [97] : Chapter 7  
 The Department of Export Promotion of the Thai  Ministry of Commerce  offers potential restaurateurs plans for three different "master restaurant" types—from fast food to elegant—which investors can choose as a prefabricated restaurant plan. [98] [99]  Concomitantly, the  Export-Import Bank of Thailand  offered loans to Thai nationals aiming to open restaurants abroad, and the Small and Medium Enterprise Development Bank of Thailand set up an infrastructure for loans of up to US$3 million for overseas food industry initiatives, including Thai restaurants. [99] 
 One survey conducted in 2003 by the  Kellogg School of Management and Sasin Institute  showed that Thai cuisine ranked fourth when people were asked to name an  ethnic  cuisine, after  Italian ,  French , and  Chinese cuisine . When asked "what is your favourite cuisine?", Thailand's cuisine came in at sixth place, behind the three aforementioned cuisines, and  Indian  and  Japanese cuisine . [92] : 3–4  
 In the list of the "World's 50 most delicious foods", compiled by  CNN  in 2011,  som tam  stands at place 46,  nam tok  mu  at 19,  tom yam  kung  at 8, and  massaman curry  stands on first place as most delicious food in the world. [100]  In a reader's poll held a few months later by CNN,  Nam tok mu  came in at 36, Thai fried rice at 24, green curry at 19,  massaman  curry at 10, and Thai  som tam , pad thai, and  tom yam kung  at six, five, and four. [101] 
 In 2012, the British  Restaurant Magazine  included Nahm Bangkok of chef  David Thompson  in its yearly list of  The World's 50 Best Restaurants . [102] 
 
 Awards [ edit ] 
 Thai chefs of the Thailand Culinary Academy took second place in the Gourmet Team Challenge (Practical) of the FHC China International Culinary Arts Competition 14 in Shanghai, China on 14–16 November 2012. They won the IKA Culinary Olympic 2012 competition held in  Erfurt , Germany between 5–10 October 2012, where they received four gold and one silver medal. [103] 
 In 2011, the  James Beard Foundation Award  for Best Chef in the  Northwestern United States , was presented to  Andy Ricker  of restaurant " Pok Pok " in  Portland, Oregon , and for Best Chef in the  Southwestern United States  to Saipin Chutima of restaurant "Lotus of Siam" in  Winchester, Nevada . [104] 
 
 Michelin stars [ edit ] 
 Three restaurants that specialize in Thai cuisine, but are owned by non-Thai chefs, have received  Michelin stars :
 
 2002 – 2011 "Nahm" in  London , run by chef  David Thompson [105] [106] 
 2009 – "Kiin Kiin" in  Copenhagen , run by chef Henrik Yde-Andersen and  Lertchai Treetawatchaiwong [107] 
 2015 – " Pok Pok  NY" in  New York City , run by chef  Andy Ricker [108] 
 Culinary tours and cooking courses [ edit ] 
   Food tours and cooking courses in Thailand almost always include a trip to the local market. 
 Culinary tours of Thailand have gained popularity in recent years. Alongside other forms of  tourism in Thailand , food tours have carved a niche for themselves. Many companies offer culinary and cooking tours of Thailand and many tourists visiting Thailand attend cooking courses offered by hotels, guesthouses and cooking schools. [109] 
 
 Governmental interventions [ edit ] 
 The Thai government believes that a substandard Thai restaurant meal served abroad "...sabotages the country's reputation." [110]  To ensure the quality of Thai food abroad, the government has over the years initiated a series of programs designed to create universal standards for Thai food.
 In 2003 the  Ministry of Finance  sent officials to the US to award certificates to deserving restaurants. On their return the project was abandoned. [110] 
 Soon thereafter, the  Ministry of Labor  created  Krua Thai Su Krua Lok  ('Thai kitchen goes global'). Its centerpiece was a 10-day Thai cooking course for those who wanted to prepare Thai food overseas. [110]  The effort was short-lived.
 After some officials had a bad Thai meal abroad, in 2013 the  Yingluck administration  had the idea of standardising Thai food everywhere. The  National Food Institute (NFI)  came up with a program called  Rod Thai Tae  ('authentic Thai taste'). [110]  A parallel effort was called the "Thai Delicious" project.
 
 Thai Delicious project [ edit ] 
 Thailand's National Innovation Agency (NIA), a public organization under the Thai  Ministry of Science and Technology , spearheaded a 30 million baht (US$1 million), [111]  effort by the government to:
 
 Develop Thai recipes with "authentic taste" and establish them as standard recipes 
 Develop biosensor equipment to analyze and evaluate taste and flavors 
 Develop institutional food (ready-to-cook products) based on the standardized recipes to meet the demand for Thai food in foreign countries 
 Provide a food certification service as well as training for local and foreign chefs working in Thai restaurants worldwide [112] 
 The agency has posted 11 "authentic" recipes for  tom yam  kung  ( nam sai ),  tom yam kung  ( nam khon ),  pad thai ,  Massaman curry ,  kaeng khiao wan  (green curry),  kaeng lueang  (southern Thai sour curry),  golek  chicken sauce,  khao soi ,  sai ua  (northern Thai sausage),  nam phrik num  (green pepper chili paste), and  nam phrik ong  (northern Thai chili paste). [113]  These recipes were featured at a gala dinner promoting "Authentic Thai Food for the World", held at the  Plaza Athénée  Hotel Bangkok on 24 August 2016 at which Thailand's Minister of Industry was the honored guest. [114]  By 2020, Thai Delicious plans to post over 300 Thai food recipes. [115] 
 To determine authenticity, Thai researchers developed the "e-delicious machine", described as "...an intelligent robot that measures smell and taste in food ingredients through sensor technology in order to measure taste like a food critic." [116]  The machine evaluates food by measuring its conductivity at different voltages. Readings from 10 sensors are combined to produce a chemical signature. Because the machine cannot judge taste, the food is compared with a standard derived from a database of popular preferences for each dish. For  tom yam , the spicy soup flavored with  Kaffir lime  leaves and  coriander , researchers posted notices at  Chulalongkorn University  in Bangkok, requesting 120 tasters. The tasters—students, university staff, and area workers—were paid a few  baht  for their opinions. They were served 10 differently prepared soups and rated each one. The winning soup was declared the standard, and its chemical characteristics were programmed into the machine. When testing food, the machine returns a numerical score from one to 100. A score lower than 80 is deemed "not up to standard". The machine cost about US$100,000 to develop. [111]  Restaurants that follow officially sanctioned recipes can affix a "Thai Delicious" logo to their menus. [111]  Each machine sold for 200,000  baht . This project was shelved. [110] 
 The Thai Delicious project has been criticized, the main rationale being that "Standardisation is the enemy of Thai food." [117]  Some observers think, however, that the quality of Thai food, at least in the US, is declining with its increased popularity, [118]  a state of affairs that Thai Delicious aims to fix.
 In August 2018, Thailand's  Ministry of Commerce  kicked off a project called "Thai Select". It issues certificates in three grades to domestic Thai restaurants: gold (five stars); red (four stars); and orange (three stars). The goal is to enable tourists to Thailand to choose a worthy restaurant. [110] 
 Culture Minister Vira Rojpojchanarat announced in 2018 that between 2020 and 2024, his ministry will investigate ways to preserve authentic Thai cuisine from the increasing influence of foreign dishes. "Unique in its preparation with recipes handed down for generations, Thai culinary art needs better protection against foreign influences which are now changing the look and taste of certain local dishes," he warned. The plan will conform to the  Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage , initiated by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation ( UNESCO ). The 2003 convention intends to protect the "uses, representations, expressions, knowledge and techniques that communities, groups and, in some cases, individuals, recognised as an integral part of their cultural heritage". [119] 
 
 Salt reduction efforts [ edit ] 
 On average, Thai people consume 4,300 mg of sodium per day, twice the  WHO 's recommended maximum. [120]  Thai street food is one of the top three contributors to high salt intake. The  Public Health Ministry  has embarked on a program to reduce the population's salt consumption by 30 percent. [121]
