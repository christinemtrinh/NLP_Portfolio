 Apulian cuisine  consists of the cooking traditions and practices of the region of  Apulia  in  Italy . Starting from the  Middle Ages  the permanent residence of the nobility in the region gradually declined, which caused the disappearance of their noble cuisine over time. As the common people suffered from poverty, their culinary tradition adapted to use cheap and simple foods. Bread, vegetables and pasta have the leading role in the cuisine. Fruits, fish and wine are consumed frequently as well, but meat plays a minor role. The food of Apulia is known as a prime example of  cucina povera  or 'cuisine of the poor', but this characterizes its simplicity rather than its quality. More so, the simple dishes allow the quality of their local and seasonal ingredients to take center stage.
 
 
 Sagre  food festivals [ edit ] 
 Apulia’s  sagre  food festivals showcase local cuisine, cooking traditions and culture. While not unique to Apulia -  sagre  festivals are one of Italy’s best kept food secrets [1]  - food is an integral part of the region’s identity and these are intensely social occasions where you can feast side by side with locals. [2] 
 
 History [ edit ] 
 After the period of  Magna Graecia , Apulia never had political autonomy. It was always a peripheral region of a larger state. From the Middle Ages until the  Italian unification  in the 19th century Apulia was controlled by the  Kingdom of Naples  and later the  Kingdom of the Two Sicilies . It was governed from  Naples  in  Campania , the capital of both kingdoms. [3] 
 The nobility, which owned large tracts of land in Apulia, preferred to live in Naples. If they spent any time in Apulia, it was for brief inspections of their properties and the collection of profits. As a consequence the cuisine of the nobility started to disappear in Apulia during the 18th and 19th centuries. The cuisine of the  monasteries , which were present in large numbers in Apulia, never became part of the local tradition. As charitable institutions which supported the poor, the food they served them was limited to soups. [4] 
 Because of these factors, the cuisine of common people defines the gastronomy of Apulia. Historically Apulia was a poor region, which meant that ingredients had to be affordable, local and seasonal. Due to this frugality vegetables attained an important role. Dishes are simple, without elaborate preparations. [5]  The food of Apulia is often characterized as  peasant food  or  cucina povera , the 'cuisine of the poor'. In spite of this, the dishes are richer and more complex than the number of ingredients and the simplicity of the cooking methods would suggest. [6] 
 The first cookbook on Apulian cuisine was  Il Libro della Cocina  from 1504, which covered the cooking of the nobility. It contains some recipes which are not Apulian, but which became part of the local tradition over time. This demonstrates that Apulians were eager to adopt cooking practices from other regions and integrate them into their own cuisine. [5] 
 In modern times Apulian cuisine distinguishes between appetizers, first and second courses. Separate courses are a relatively new addition to the cuisine, because in the past a meal used to consist of a single dish. Many dishes now served as appetizers were inspired by single dishes which made up an entire meal. Some dishes which are now served as first courses can still be quite filling and rich in ingredients, which reflect their use as a single dish for the entire meal. [7] 
 
 Ingredients and dishes [ edit ] 
 Snacks and appetizers [ edit ] 
   Panzerotto  is a turnover, traditionally deep-fried and often filled with  mozzarella  and tomato. 
   Focaccia Barese  with tomatoes and olives. 
 Many foods which are eaten as a snack or appetizer are based on bread. The  puccia  (plural  pucce ) is a small, flat and round bread which may or may not have olives mixed through its dough. The version with olives is eaten as is, but the version without olives is sliced open and stuffed with many kinds of vegetables, meat or seafood. [8]  The  panzerotto  is a  turnover  filled with various stuffings. A combination of  tomatoes  and  mozzarella  is popular. They are similar to the  calzone  of Naples, but are smaller and use a softer dough. They can be baked in the oven like  calzone , but deep frying is traditional. [9]   Focaccia Barese  is a local variation of  focaccia  originating from  Bari , which is covered with tomatoes,  oregano  and optionally  olives , with  olive oil  drizzled on top. [10] 
 The  rustico  which is popular in the area of  Lecce  doesn't use bread but  puff pastry  as a base. The pastry is filled with  béchamel  sauce,  mozzarella  and  tomato sauce  and then baked in the oven. [11]   Scagliozzi  may be the only popular way to eat  polenta  in Apulia.  Polenta  is prepared normally and then allowed to cool and dry. It is then cut in slices and deep fried. [7]   Pettole  are deep-fried  croquettes  made from a liquid batter of flour with yeast, which may include boiled  potatoes . There are both flavoured versions with small pieces of fish or vegetables and sweet versions. [12] 
 Taralli  are popular toroidal  crackers  made with flour, olive oil, white wine and salt along with other ingredients. The classical version uses  fennel  seeds, but they come in many variations and can be savoury or sweet. [13]  They are eaten as is or dunked in wine.
 
 Bread [ edit ] 
   Pane di Altamura  is bread made entirely of durum flour. 
 Bread is a very important part of the Apulian diet. The vast majority of  wheat  cultivated in Puglia is  durum wheat , with minimal production of  common wheat . [14]  For this reason many types of bread are made entirely or partially with durum wheat. The most highly regarded breads are  Pane di Altamura ,  Pane di Laterza  and  Pane di Monte Sant'Angelo . [15]   Pane di Altamura  was granted  Protected Designation of Origin  (PDO) status in the  European Union  (EU) and is made entirely with durum wheat flour, just like  Pane di Laterza .  Pane di Monte Sant'Angelo  stands out because it is traditionally made with only common wheat flour. [16] 
 Frisella  is a bread with a long shelf life, making it a suitable alternative to fresh bread. It has a toroidal shape with a hole in the center, which facilitated stringing them together for storage and transport. The dough is made with either wheat, durum or barley flour. After a first stage of baking in the oven, the friselle is cut horizontally and then baked in the oven again until they are completely dry. Before consumption the friselle is soaked in water until it is still crisp but not mushy. It is then eaten with a variety of toppings. [17] 
 Instead of disposing of  stale  bread, Apulians have invented many dishes to make it palatable.  Cialledda , also called  aquasale , is one of these. After soaking bread in water to soften it, it is combined with tomatoes, olive oil and salt. [18]  The dish  pancotto  is similar, but more elaborate with more ingredients. [19]  Stale bread is also used to make dry  breadcrumbs  which can be used a garnish for several dishes. [20] 
 
 Cheese [ edit ] 
   Pallone di Gravina  is an aged cow's milk cheese. 
 The cheese from Apulia which is most popular internationally is the fresh cheese  burrata . This cheese consists of an outer shell of  mozzarella  which is filled with  stracciatella  and cream. Only  burrata di  Andria  is protected under the  Protected Geographical Indication  (PGI) status by the EU, so the generic name is also used for  burrata  produced outside Apulia. The PDO cheeses of Apulia are the aged  caciocavallo Silano ,  canestrato Pugliese  and fresh  mozzarella di bufala Campana . Other cheeses include  caciocavallo podolico ,  cacioricotta Pugliese ,  pallone di Gravina  and several varieties of  ricotta , of which  ricotta forte  has an especially strong flavor.
 
 Fruit [ edit ] 
 Just like other regions in  Southern Italy , olive oil is the principal cooking fat. [6]  While table olives are now frequently served as appetizers, they were even more important in the past as they were often the only available food next to bread. [21]  Apulia is Italy's largest producer of olive oil and table olives, [22]  with many local varieties. No less than five of these oils and one table olive, respectively the  Collina di Brindisi ,  Dauno ,  Terra di Bari ,  Terra d'Otranto ,  Terre Tarentine  and  La Bella della Daunia , are protected under the PDO status.
 Many different sweet fruits are enjoyed as a dessert at the end of a meal. [23]  The  arancia del Gargano  and  clementine del Golfo di Taranto  are respectively an  orange  and clementine which enjoy PDO status. The  limone femminello del Gargano  is a  lemon  which was granted PGI status. The fruit of the  prickly pear  cactus which dots the countryside is consumed as well. [24] 
 
 Soups [ edit ] 
 Soups are especially popular as winter dishes, with a main role for vegetables along with legumes and short pasta shapes. Bread is often included as well, either on the side or included in the soup. [25]  The bread dishes  cialledda  and  pancotto  may also be prepared in the form of a soup if a vegetable broth is added. [26]  A soup from the  Salento  is called  cecamariti , literally meaning 'blinding the husband'. The dish received its name from its impressive appearance, which conceals its easy preparation. [27]  There are also fish soups, which feature a rich broth due to the addition of small fish with bones included. [25] 
 
 Pasta [ edit ] 
   Orecchiette  is the emblematic pasta shape of Apulia. 
 Eggs are an essential ingredient for pasta in  Northern Italy , but in Apulia and other regions of Southern Italy only  semolina  and water is used. This was done mainly for economic reasons, because eggs were considered too valuable for an everyday dish like pasta. Omitting eggs from pasta dough allowed their use in other dishes. [28] 
 Orechiette  is considered the signature pasta shape of Apulia, but there are many other shapes as well. These include  cavatelli ,  capunti  (typical of the  Murgia plateau ),  troccoli  (from the  Daunia ),  lagane  and  sagne . [29]   Orrechiette  is frequently combined with fried  cime di rape  in  orrechiette con le cime di rape . [30]  Next to the familiar combinations of pasta with tomato sauces, meat and seafood, there are some typically Apulian pairings with vegetables. For example, the dish  ciceri e tria  uses  chickpeas  and  lagane con puré di fave  uses  broad bean  puree. [31] 
 Pasta can also be made with  grano arso , 'burnt grain'. In the past the remaining ears of grains would be gathered from the grain fields after the grain harvest, when the grain stubbles were burnt to clear the field. While this used to be done out of extreme poverty or frugality, pasta made with  grano arso  is now considered a delicacy. [32] 
 
 Vegetables [ edit ] 
 Broad beans  and  cime di rape  are the iconic vegetables of Apulia. The broad bean has been the  staple food  in the region for thousands of years. In its dried and split form it is the main ingredient of the famous dish  fave e cicoria . Other frequently used vegetables include  fennel ,  zucchini ,  artichoke ,  bell pepper ,  cauliflower ,  eggplant , wild leaf  chicory , the  cardoncello mushroom  and  broccoli . [33]  The  carciofo Brindisino  and  lenticchia di Altamura  are respectively artichokes and lentils which have attained the PGI status from the EU.
 Many vegetables are preserved with the  sott'olio  method, meaning 'under the oil'. First vegetables are boiled in white  wine vinegar . After they are combined with spices and herbs they are placed in jars. The vegetables are then covered by filling the jar with olive oil, so that they are not in contact with air. This allows the vegetables to be preserved for up to year and also enhances their flavor. [34] 
 
   Lampascioni  preserved  sott'olio  in olive oil. 
 Apulian cooking also uses some less widely known vegetables. The  tassel hyacinth  grows widespread in the wild and is used for its bulb. Known as  lampascioni  in Apulia, these are usually boiled in water and seasoned with olive oil, vinegar, salt and black pepper. They can also be grilled or deep-fried. [35] 
 The black chickpea ( ceci neri ) was consumed more often before the 1950s, but production dropped as it was replaced by more profitable crops and legumes with shorter cooking times. Today production is centered in the Murgia plateau. [36]  Because they have a stronger taste than the white variety, they are often just boiled in water and served with oil, possibly combined with a small type of pasta. [37] 
 The  grass pea  ( cicerchia ) used to be popular in cookbooks of the 1600s, but has since fallen out of favor because the plant provides a limited yield and is toxic if eaten as a staple. In recent times the crop has been rediscovered and is cultivated in the  Alta Murgia  and the Salento. It is used in soups and stews. [38] 
 
 Seafood [ edit ] 
   Scapece  from Gallipoli is fried fish preserved in red wine vinegar with breadcrumbs and saffron. 
 Because Apulia is a peninsula, it has a long coastline and the sea is never far away. This has made seafood an important part of its cuisine. The large variety of seafood that is available includes  sea bream ,  octopus ,  prawns ,  oysters ,  anchovies ,  mussels  and  clams . The region has been compared with  Japan  for its love of raw fish. [39] 
 One of the more popular dishes is  tiella , a slow-cooked dish layered with rice, potatoes and mussels. [20]  This version originates from  Bari , but there is plenty of local variation in the recipe, with different versions originating from  Foggia ,  Taranto  and the Salento. Some of these don't even include seafood. [40]   Scapece  is a fish dish from  Gallipoli, Apulia  which is notable for its preservation method. Similar to  escabeche , fish is fried and then preserved in red wine vinegar with breadcrumbs and  saffron  to greatly extend its shelf life. [41]  Some dishes use  dried and salted cod  ( baccalà ), one of the very few imported ingredients. [40] 
 
 Meat [ edit ] 
 In the past meat was a scarcity due to its expense. For this reason, it is not an important component of the cuisine of Apulia.  Beef  was lacking almost entirely from the diet in the past, because cattle was used for farm work or reared for milk. It was slaughtered only when it was very old. Likewise, the prevalence of  horse meat  is explained by the slaughter of lame horses which were no longer able to work.  Lamb ,  poultry  and  rabbit  (often reared on farms) and to a lesser degree game were the main sources of meat. A farm used to raise a single pig, of which every part would be used when it was slaughtered. Some of its meat would be consumed directly, but most of it would be preserved as ham, sausages and  salami . [42] 
 The Apulian recipe for  ragù  differs from the version prepared in other Italian regions. Traditionally it uses sun-dried tomato pulp ( conserva ) as a base, which is then fried in olive oil with some water, fresh tomatoes and optionally  chili pepper  and red wine. Then meat  braciole  (or  involtini ) are added, which can be used together with the sauce to dress pasta dishes. [43]  Apart from quality cuts of meat, there are also recipes which call for  offal  in the form of roulades and  pig's trotters . [44] 
 
 Sweets [ edit ] 
   A  torta  pasticciotto  filled with almonds and figs. 
 The ingredients for sweets are sometimes influenced by the Middle East and include  almonds ,  figs ,  hazelnuts ,  pistachios  and spices. The traditional sweetener is  honey , which is still frequently used. Fresh soft ricotta is used as well. [45] 
 
 Wine [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Apulian wine 
 In 2017 Apulia overtook  Veneto  as the largest wine producing region in Italy, with a total production of 9.070.112 hectoliters. [22]  It has been producing grapes with a high alcohol content for ages, which were used by other regions in Italy and  France  for mixing with their own wines. Since the 1990s Apulian winemakers have started taking more risks and using more innovative winemaking techniques. Today it produces wines with many different indigenous grape varieties. The most well-known wine internationally is  Primitivo  di  Manduria , but there are many other varieties such as the  Negroamaro ,  Bombino Bianco ,  Pampanuto ,  Verdeca ,  Bianco d'Alessano  and  Susumaniello . [39]
