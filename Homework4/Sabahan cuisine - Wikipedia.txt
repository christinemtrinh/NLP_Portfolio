 Cookbook: Cuisine of Malaysia 
 
   Malaysia portal   Food portal v t e 
 Sabahan cuisine  is a regional cuisine of  Malaysia . As in the rest of  Malaysian cuisine , Sabah food is based on staples such as rice with a great variety of other ingredients and different methods of food preparations due to the influence of the state's varied geography and indigenous cultures that were quite distinct from the regional cuisines of the  Peninsular Malaysia .  Sabah  along with its neighbour of  Sarawak  is famous for their multi-ethnic population.
 
 
 Dishes [ edit ] 
   Amplang. 
 Among the foods and beverages particular to Sabah are:
 
 Amplang  is a type of cracker made from Spanish mackerel, tapioca starch and other seasonings, and then deep fried. [1] 
   Beaufort Mee Beaufort mee  ( Chinese :  保佛炒面 ;  pinyin :  Bǎo fú chǎomiàn ) is a speciality of  Beaufort  town. Handmade noodles are smoked, then wok-tossed with meat (usually slices of char siu and marinated pork) or seafood and plenty of  choy sum , and finished off with a thick viscous gravy. [2] 
 Bosou , also called  noonsom  or  tonsom , is the Kadazan-Dusun term for a traditional recipe of tangy  fermented meat . Smoked and pulverised buah keluak (nuts from the Kepayang tree ( Pangium edule ) which grows in Malaysia's mangrove swamplands), or  pangi  is a key ingredient and acts as a preservative. Combined with rice, salt and fresh meat or fish, the mixture is then placed into a sealed jar or container for fermentation. Contemporary variants for  bosou  add bananas and pineapples to the mixture. [3]   Pinongian  is a variant where rice is omitted to produce a final product which is much less tangy in taste; however, unlike bosou, "pinongian" must be cooked before serving. 
 Century egg dumpling  ( Chinese :  皮蛋饺 ;  pinyin :  pí dàn jǐao ) is a speciality of  Sandakan  town. The dumpling is added with a cutlet of century egg & may be served along with noodles. [4] 
 Fried pork  ( Chinese :  炸肉 ;  pinyin :  zhà ròu ) is a speciality of  Sandakan  town. The specially marinated pork is fried & later cut to slices, usually served along with soup & wide vermicelli, also commonly served with dried noodle. [4] 
   Swordfish  hinava served with  sandwich bread . 
 Hinava  is a traditional Kadazan-Dusun dish of raw fish cured in lime juice. Typically, firm fleshed white fish like mackerel ( hinava sada tongii ) is marinated with lime juice, sliced shallots, chopped chilli, julienned ginger and grated dried seed of the  bambangan  fruit. Optional additions may include sliced bitter gourd. Hinava may also be made with prawns ( hinava gipan ). 
 Kelupis  is a type of food wrapped in leaf. 
 Ketupat  is a type of food wrapped in leaf. 
 Linongot  is a type of leaf parcel (usually  irik  or tarap leaves)  filled with a combination of cooked rice and root vegetables like sweet potatoes and yam. [5]  Alternate names known by Kadazan-Dusun communities in other districts include  linopod  and  sinamazan . [6] 
 Nasi kombos  is a rice dish from the  Lotud  community. [6]  Glutinous rice is first cooked with young coconut water, and then mixed with the grated tender flesh of a young coconut. The rice is traditionally served in a hollowed out coconut shell. [7] 
 Nonsoom bambangan  is a pickle made from half ripe bambangan fruit mixed with grated dried bambangan seed and salt, sealed in a tightly covered jar and left to ferment for weeks. [8] 
   Ngiu Chap (soup) Ngiu chap  ( Chinese :  牛什 ;  pinyin :  Niú shén ) is a Chinese-influenced dish of beef or buffalo broth served with noodles, usually immersed in the soup with slices of poached beef or buffalo meat, meatballs, stewed brisket, tendon, liver and various offal parts. An iconic Sabahan dish, ngiu chap has many different variations, from the lighter Hainanese style to heartier Hakka-influenced flavours, and even village-style ngiu chap adapted for indigenous tastes. [9] 
 Nuba laya/Nuba tinga  is an ordinary rice wrapped with  banana leaf  or nyrik leaf. This dishes is to ease the farmer and the traveller for them to carry for a long journey. Usually this dishes is very famous among the  Lun Bawang/Lundayeh  people and this dishes a bit similarity to the linongot. However, this Nuba Tinga/Nuba laya is different because the rice is very soft and can bitten easily by senior citizen. Nuba means Rice, Laya means soft while tinga means wrapped thus Nuba laya means soft rice and nuba tingga means wrapped rice. 
 Piaren Ah Manuk  is a chicken curry made from a sauteed  rempah  base and grated coconut, then braised in coconut milk. This dish is very popular in the  Iranun  community. [10]  Variants include fish (Piaren Ah Sada) and unripe jackfruit (Piaren Ah Badak). 
 Pinasakan  or  Pinarasakan  is a home-style Kadazan-Dusun dish of fish simmered with  takob-akob  (dried skin of a mangosteen-like fruit which functions as a souring agent) or slices of unripe  bambangan , as well as fresh turmeric leaves and rhizome. [11] 
 Sagol  or  sinagol  is a Bajau speciality of fish which is first blanched and minced, then sauteed with turmeric, garlic, ginger, onions and crushed lemongrass. Traditionally the oil used is rendered fish liver oil, usually from the same fish used to prepare this dish. This dish may be prepared with  shark ,  stingray  and even  puffer fish . [12] 
   Sang Nyuk Mian (Dry Variety) Sang nyuk mian  ( Chinese :  生肉面 ;  pinyin :  Shēngròu miàn ) is a dish of noodles served with pork broth, originating from  Tawau . Very popular with the non-Muslim communities of Sabah, it is named after the poached-to-order slices of tender marinated pork served in pork broth which is flavoured with fried lard bits. The noodles (usually thick yellow noodles) are either dressed in dark soy and lard, or dunked into the soup along with the aforementioned pork slices, vegetables, meatballs and offal. [13] 
 Sinalau  refers to Kadazan-Dusun style smoked meat, which is usually wild boar or  bakas . Barbecued on a char grill and eaten with rice and dipping sauces, sinalau bakas can be found and purchased in rural areas and towns. Halal versions substitute wild boar for other game meats like deer. [14] 
 Sinamu baka  is a  Lun Bawang/Lundayeh  traditional food. This is a tangy fermented food same like  Bosuo  but the differences is Sinamu Baka only suitable for wild bear meat. 
 Tompek  is a Bajau food made from grated  tapioca , eaten as an alternative starchy staple to rice. The grated tapioca is squeezed to dry out mixture and crumbled, then fried or toasted until golden brown. [15]  Grated tapioca may also be packed into cylindrical shapes and steamed until it forms into a chewy tubular cake called  putu , another traditional Bajau staple. [12] 
   Tuaran mee. 
 Tuaran mee  ( Chinese :  斗亚兰面 ;  pinyin :  Dòu yà lán miàn ) is a speciality of  Tuaran  town. This dish of wok fried fresh handmade noodles is well known in the nearby city of Kota Kinabalu as well as in neighbouring  Tamparuli  town, where the localised adaptation is called Tamparuli mee ( Chinese :  担波罗利炒生面 ;  pinyin :  Dān bō luó lì chǎo shēng miàn ). The noodles must first be toasted with oil in the wok to prevent it from clumping together, then blanched to reduce the stiff crunchy texture from toasting. The final step involves stir frying the noodles to a dry finish with eggs, vegetables, and meat or seafood. [2] 
 Tuhau  ( Etlingera coccinea ) is a type of wild ginger, specifically the stems of the same plant popularly served as a relish by the Kadazan-Dusun community. The stems are typically chopped up and served fresh with lime juice, or mixed with local chives and chilli peppers then cured with salt and vinegar. A more recent recipe called  serunding tuhau  involves slicing tuhau stems into thin floss-like shreds, which is then sauteed until it becomes golden and crisp. It has a distinctive scent which is said to have a polarising effect even among indigenous Sabahans. [11] 
 Ubi Daun Kayu  is the tapioca leaves and also the traditional food for  Murut  and  Lun Bawang/Lundayeh 
 UFO tart  (also known as cow-dung tart,  Chinese :  牛屎挞 ;  simplified Chinese :  牛屎塔 ;  traditional Chinese :  牛屎撻 ;  pinyin :  níu shǐ tǎ ) is a famous pastry in  Sandakan  town. It's made of custard & cream shaped like a cow dung on top of a thin fluffy slice of round shaped cake. [16]
