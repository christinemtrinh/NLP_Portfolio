   Location of  Asia . 
 Asian food incorporates a few significant provincial cooking styles: Central Asian, East Asian, North Asian, South Asian, Southeast Asian, and West Asian. A food is a trademark way of cooking practices and customs, [1]  usually associated with a specific  culture . Asia, being the largest and most populous  continent , is home to many cultures, many of which have their own characteristic cuisine. Asian cuisine are also famous about their spices, Asian people traditionally use different kind of spices in their regular meals. 
 Ingredients common to many cultures in the East and Southeast regions of the continent include rice, ginger, garlic, sesame seeds, chilies, dried onions, soy, and tofu.  Stir frying , steaming, and  deep frying  are common cooking methods.
 While rice is common to most Asian cuisines, different varieties are popular in the various regions.  Glutinous rice  is ingrained in the culture, religious tradition and national identity of  Laos . [2]  Basmati rice is popular in the  Indian subcontinent ,  jasmine rice  is often found across  Southeast Asia , while long-grain rice is popular in China and short-grain in Japan and Korea. [3] 
 Curry  is a common dish in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia. Curry dishes have their origins in the Indian subcontinent, with present-day  Armenia  mainly using a meat base, while those in  India  and Southeast Asia generally use vegetarian foundation. [4] 
 
 
 History [ edit ] 
 This section  needs expansion . You can help by  adding to it .   ( February 2022 ) 
 A heavily influential aspect of Asian culture is the food, especially the various traditional ways of Asian cuisine and cooking. [5]  Although many Asian cultures often share the traditions of bringing the family or group together to socialize or have celebrations over a meal, the various cultures of Asia each developed their own individual ethnic cultural takes on food through the interaction of history, culture, and environment.  [5] 
 
 Central Asian cuisine [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Central Asian cuisine 
 
 
 
 
 Location of  Central Asia .
 
 
 
 
 Most Central Asian nations have similar cuisines to each other as well as their neighbors, taking many features of the neighboring cuisines of Western and Eastern Asia, particularly  Iran  and  Mongolia .  A dish known as "plov", or "osh", for example, is a widespread variation of  pilaf . However, many of the same countries use  horse meat  and  mutton  as the most common meats, similar to  beef . This is owing to  Mongolian cuisine . In  Kazakhstan  and  Kyrgyzstan , the cuisine has evolved to meet the needs of a nomad lifestyle.
 Kumis  is a widespread drink among  Turkic peoples , especially in Central Asia.
 Central Asia is also noted for being the birthplace of  yogurt . Like kumis, it is widespread among Turkic peoples.
 
 East Asian cuisine [ edit ] 
 Main article:  East Asian cuisine 
 
 
 
 
 Location of  East Asia .
 
 
 
 
 East Asian cuisine includes  Chinese ,  Japanese ,  Korean ,  Mongolian ,  Taiwanese , and  Tibetan  food. Considering this is the most populated region of the world, it has many regional cuisines (especially in China). Examples of staple foods include  rice ,  noodles ,  mung beans ,  soybeans ,  seafood  (Japan has the highest per capita consumption of seafood),  mutton  (Mongolia),  bok choy  (Chinese cabbage), and  tea .
 
 North Asian cuisine [ edit ] 
 
 
 
 
 Location of  Northern Asia .
 
 
 
 
 North Asian cuisine is often synonymous with  Russian cuisine , due to all of Northern Asia being a part of the Russian Federation.  However, some cultures or areas of Siberia have in-depth cuisine, such as the  Yakuts  (or Sakha) and  Yamal cuisine .   Buryats  also have their own cuisine, although it is very similar to that of the related  Mongolians .
 Pelmeni , originally a  Permic  or  Ugric  dish, has entered into mainstream Russian cuisine as a well-known dish, but it can still be considered part of the Yamal cuisine for its area of origin.  Some speculate them to be a simplified version of the Chinese  wonton .  In  Siberia , pelmeni is frozen outdoors to preserve the meat inside throughout the long winter.  In  Yamal , other types of drying and preservation are common.  Key ingredients in most northern Siberian cuisine include fish and  cowberries , sometimes known as lingonberries in Europe and North America.  Yakuts, like many other  Turkic-speaking peoples , traditionally enjoy  kumis  as a common drink.
 
 South Asian cuisine [ edit ] 
 Main article:  South Asian cuisine 
 
 
 
 
 Location of  South Asia .
 
 
 
 
 South Asian cuisine includes  cuisines  from the  Indian subcontinent . Food items in this region are generally rich in spices, however it also caters a blend of multi-cuisine culture from all across the world. Food is flavored with various types of chili, black pepper, cloves, condiments and other herbs and spices. Use of flavored butter and  ghee  is prominent in many places. Turmeric, coriander, and cumin are often used to make curries.
 The multitude is inclined more towards the usage of mustard, groundnut, sunflower and soybean oil for cooking. Usage of refined oil to make  pooris  is quite famous.   Poori Bhaji ,  Idli ,  Dosa ,  Dal Baati ,  Litti Chokha  are among the most popular and representative dishes of Indian cuisines.
 Vegetables are generally eaten with a type of bread called  Chapati  which is the staple food of the region. Rice is generally taken with  dal  to moisten it in the northern parts and with curd as you move towards the southern region. 
 Tea and coffee are prominent all across with the former available at every street corner. Egg dishes are also available in similar fashion.
 Common meats include lamb, goat, fish, and chicken.  Beef  is less common than in  Western  cuisines because cattle have a special place in  Hinduism . Prohibitions against beef extend to the meat of cows, and  yaks  to some extent.  Pork  is considered a  taboo food item  by all Muslims and is avoided by some Hindus. Other minorities also prohibit the use of meat to abjure violence. Fish is commonly used in South India, Sri Lanka and the Bengal region i.e. (Bangladesh and West Bengal state of India). The Northern region diet mostly include wheat,  and other major crops .
 
 Southeast Asian cuisine [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Southeast Asian cuisine 
 
 
 
 
 Location of  Southeast Asia .
 
 
 
 
 Southeast Asian cuisine includes a strong emphasis on lightly prepared dishes with a strong aromatic component that features such flavors as citrus and herbs such as  lime ,  coriander / cilantro  and  basil . Ingredients in the region contrast with the ones in the East Asian cuisines, substituting  fish sauces  for sauce and the inclusion of ingredients such as  galangal ,  tamarind  and  lemongrass . Cooking methods include a balance of  stir-frying , boiling and steaming.
 
 West Asian cuisine [ edit ] 
 Main article:  West Asian cuisine 
 
 
 
 
 Location of  Western Asia .
 
 
 
 
 West Asian cuisine significantly overlaps with the Middle Eastern cuisine and the inclusion of the  South Caucasus .
 West Asian cuisine is the  cuisine  of the various countries and peoples of West Asia. The cuisine of the region is diverse while having a degree of homogeneity. [6]  Some commonly used ingredients include  olives  and  olive oil ,  pitas ,  honey ,  sesame  seeds,  dates , [6]   sumac ,  chickpeas ,  mint  and  parsley . Some popular dishes include  kibbeh  and  shawarma .
 Cereals constitute the basis of West Asian diet, both historically and today.  Wheat  and  rice  are the major and preferred sources of staple foods.  Barley  is also widely used in the region and  maize  has become common in some areas as well. Bread is a universal staple, eaten in one form or another by all classes and groups practically at every meal.
 Butter and clarified butter (also known as Semna) are, traditionally, the preferred medium of cooking. Olive oil is prevalent in the Mediterranean coastal areas. Christians use it during Lent, when meat and dairy products are excluded, and Jews use it in place of animal fats such as butter to avoid mixing meat and dairy products.
 Lamb and mutton have always been the favored meats of West Asia. Pork is prohibited in both Islam and Judaism, and as such is rarely eaten in the region. Prominent among the meat preparations are grilled meats, or  kebabs . Meat and vegetable stews, served with rice, bulgur, or bread, are another form of meat preparation in the region.
 Vegetables and pulses are the predominant staples of the great majority of the people in the West Asia. They are boiled, stewed, grilled, stuffed, and cooked with meat and rice. Among the green leafy vegetables, many varieties of cabbage, spinach, and chard are widely used. Root and bulb vegetables, such as onions and garlic, as well as carrots, turnips, and beets are equally common.
