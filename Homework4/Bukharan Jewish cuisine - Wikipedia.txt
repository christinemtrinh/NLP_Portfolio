 Traditional cuisine of the Bukharian Jewish community 
 Bukharan Jewish cuisine  is the traditional cuisine originating from the  Bukharian Jewish  community of  Central Asia , who now mostly reside in  Israel , and the  United States .
 
 
 Overview [ edit ] 
   Central Asian-style  dumpling  soup called  shurbo   dushpera  or  tushpera  (left), along with traditional  tandoor bread  called  lepyoshka  in Russian and  non  in  Uzbek ,  Tajik , and  Bukharian  (right) 
 The cooking of  Bukharan Jews  forms a distinct cuisine within Uzbekistan, subject to the restrictions of  Jewish dietary laws . [1]  The most typical Bukharan Jewish dish is  oshi sabo  (also  osh savo  or  osovoh ), a "meal in a pot" slowly cooked overnight and eaten hot for  Shabbat  lunch. Oshi sabo is made with meat, rice, vegetables, and fruit added for a unique sweet and sour taste. [2]   By virtue of its culinary function (a hot Shabbat meal in Jewish homes) and ingredients (rice, meat, vegetables cooked together overnight), oshi sabo is a Bukharan version of  cholent  or  hamin .
 In addition to  oshi sabo , authentic Bukharian Jewish dishes include the following dishes. [3] 
 
 Meat dishes [ edit ] 
 Osh palov  - a Bukharian Jewish version of  palov  for weekdays, includes both beef and  chicken . 
 Bakhsh  - "green palov", rice with meat or chicken and green herbs ( coriander ,  parsley ,  dill ), exists in two varieties; bakhshi  khaltagi  cooked Jewish-style in a small bag immersed in a pot with boiling water or soup and bakhshi  degi  cooked like regular palov in a cauldron; [4]  bakhshi  khaltagi  is precooked and therefore can be served on  Shabbat . 
 Khalta savo  - food cooked in a bag (usually rice and meat, possibly with the addition of dried fruit). [1] [5] 
 "osh savo" - rice cooked with meat and red pepper, tomato, zucchini...and usually cooked on Friday night through Saturday morning in the oven. 
 Yakhni  - a dish consisting of two kinds of boiled meat (beef and chicken), brought whole to the table and sliced before serving with a little broth and a garnish of boiled vegetables; a main course for  Friday night dinner . [1] 
 Kov roghan  - fried pieces of chicken with fried potatoes piled on top. [6] 
 Rice dishes [ edit ] 
 Serkaniz  ( Sirkoniz ) - garlic rice dish, another variation of  palov . [ citation needed ] 
 Oshi piyozi  - stuffed onion. [4] 
 Shulah  - a Bukharian-style  risotto . 
 Vegetable dishes [ edit ] 
 Boyjon  - eggplant puree mixed only with salt and garlic, the traditional starter for the Friday-night meal in Bukharan Jewish homes. [1] 
 Slotah Bukhori  - a salad made with tomato, cucumber, green onion, cilantro, salt, pepper, and lemon juice. Some also put in lettuce and chili pepper. 
 Bread dishes [ edit ] 
 Noni Toki  - a crispy flat bread that is baked on the back of a wok. This method creates a bowl shaped bread. 
 Fish dishes [ edit ] 
 Fried fish with garlic sauce (for  Friday night dinner ): [4]  "Every Bukharian Sabbath ... is greeted with a dish of fried fish covered with a pounded sauce of garlic and cilantro." [7]  In the Bukharan dialect, the dish is called  mai birion  or in full  mai birion ovi sir , where  mai birion  is fried fish and  ovi sir  is garlic sauce (literally "garlic water"). [1]  Bread is sometimes fried and then dipped in the remaining garlic water and is called  noni-sir .
