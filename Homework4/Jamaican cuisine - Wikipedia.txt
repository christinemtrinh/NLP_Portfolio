 Culinary traditions of Jamaica 
 Jamaican cuisine  includes a mixture of cooking techniques, flavours and spices influenced by  Amerindian ,  African ,  Irish ,  English ,  French ,  Portuguese ,  Spanish ,  Indian ,  Chinese  and  Middle Eastern  people who have inhabited the island. It is also influenced by the crops introduced into the island from tropical  Southeast Asia , many of which are now grown locally. A wide variety of  seafood ,  tropical fruits  and  meats  are available.
 Some Jamaican dishes are variations on cuisines brought to the island from elsewhere. These are often modified to incorporate local produce and spices. Others are novel or  fusion  and have developed locally. Popular Jamaican dishes include  curry goat , fried  dumplings ,  ackee and saltfish .
 Jamaican patties  along with various pastries, breads and beverages are also popular.
 Jamaican cuisine has spread with emigrants, especially during the 20th century, from the island to other nations as Jamaicans have sought economic opportunities in other countries.
 
 
 History [ edit ]

 Development of the cuisine [ edit ] 
 African cuisine  developed on the island as a result of waves of  slavery , such as  callaloo  from the  Angolan  dish  calulu . The fruit of the most popular Jamaican dish,  ackee , was also brought to the Island by West African peoples. The  Spanish , the first European arrivals to the island, contributed dishes such as the  vinegary  escovitch fish (Spanish  escabeche ) contributed by  Spanish Jews . Later, the  Cornish  may have influenced the development of the  Jamaican patty , a  pasty -styled  turnover  filled with spiced meat.  More  Chinese  and  East Indian  influences can also be found in Jamaican cuisine like  roti  and  curry goat  as a result of  indentured  labourers who replaced  slaves  after  emancipation  brought their own culinary talents (especially  curry , which Jamaican chefs sometimes use to season  goat  meat for special occasions).  Salted codfish  was brought by  Portuguese Jews  who had escaped the inquisition in the 1500s and now used in the national dish  ackee and saltfish , but was also a staple for enslaved Africans as a long-lasting, affordable protein.
 
 Jamaican cuisine and the Rastafarians [ edit ] 
 Jamaican cuisine includes  Rastafarian  influences but not entirely. Rastafarians have a vegetarian approach to preparing food, cooking, and eating, and have introduced a host of unique vegetarian dishes to the Jamaican cuisine. Rastafarians do not eat pork. However, pork is a very popular dish in Jamaica. Stew pork and jerk pork are some of the most popular ways to prepare it. There are even some who believe in cooking with little or no salt, which is referred to as the ' Ital ' way.
