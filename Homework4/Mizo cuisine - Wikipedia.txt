 Mizo cuisine  is the traditional cuisine of the  Mizo people  of  Mizoram , India. Mizos are traditionally  rice  eaters.
 
 
 Overview [ edit ] 
 The cuisine of  Mizoram  shares characteristics to other regions of  Northeast India  and North India. Rice is the staple food of Mizoram, while Mizos love to add non-vegetarian ingredients in every dish. Fish, chicken, pork and beef are popular meats among Mizos. Dishes are cooked in any available oil. Meals tend to be blander with less oil and more vegetables. Most Mizos love eating boiled vegetables along with rice but the younger generation tends to like fried and spicy food; food from other cultures are also a popularity among many young Mizo. A popular dish is  bai , made from boiling vegetables (the ingredients tend to differ from household to household) with  bekang  (fermented soybeans) or  sa-um , a fermented pork, and served with rice.  Sawhchiar  is another common dish, made of rice and cooked with beef, pork or chicken. [1] [2]
