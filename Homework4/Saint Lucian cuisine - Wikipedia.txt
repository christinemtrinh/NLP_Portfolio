 Culinary traditions of Saint Lucia 
 Saint Lucian cuisine  is a combination of  French ,  East Indian  and  British  dishes. Before colonization, the  Caribs  and the  Arawaks  occupied the island, surviving on its various natural fruits and vegetables like  mangoes ,  oranges ,  tangerines ,  avocados , and  breadfruits . 
 
 Specialties [ edit ] 
   Bouyon 
 St Lucia is known for its national dish consisting of  green bananas  and  salt fish  locally known as green figs and saltfish;  breadfruit  and salt fish is also an alternative favourite among the locals. [1] 
 
   Callaloo 
 Other speciality dishes include a dish known as  bouyon , which is a thick red beans one pot soup meal made of meat, ground provisions (ground tuber foods) and vegetables. Other popular local dishes include  callaloo  soup, Accra (a fried snack composed of flour, egg, seasoning and the main ingredient of saltfish, usually prepared around  Easter ), green fig salad, cocoa tea (a traditional breakfast spiced hot drink) and bakes (which is a fried bread; it is also referred to as floats) among others. [2] 
 
   Golden Apple 
 The island's British and Indian influences are seen in the variety of spices used in its cuisine, which include garlic,  cinnamon ,  nutmeg ,  cocoa ,  parsley ,  cloves , and  allspice . A wide range of local fruits like  golden apples , mangoes,  starfruit ,  tamarind  are used to make juices, although  lime juice  (lime squash) seems a more popular choice to be enjoyed in conjunction with the local delicacies. [3]
