 Cuisine of Ancient Greece 
 Ancient Greek  cuisine  was characterized by its  frugality  for most, reflecting  agricultural  hardship, but a great diversity of ingredients was known, and wealthy Greeks were known to celebrate with elaborate meals and feasts. [1] : 95(129c)  
 The cuisine was founded on the "Mediterranean triad" of  cereals ,  olives , and  grapes , [2]  which had many uses and great commercial value, but other ingredients were as important, if not more so, to the average diet: most notably  legumes . Research suggests that the agricultural system of Ancient Greece could not have succeeded without the cultivation of legumes. [3] 
 Modern knowledge of ancient Greek cuisine and eating habits is derived from textual, archeological, and artistic evidence.
 
 
 Meals [ edit ]

 In the homeric epics of  Iliad  and  Odyssey , three meals are mentioned.
 
 Ariston (ἄριστον) 
 Dorpon (δόρπον) or Dorpos (δόρπος) 
 Deipnon (δεῖπνον) 
 Ariston was the early meal, while dorpon was the late meal. Deipnon could be either, without reference to time. [4] [5] 
 In the later age Greeks had the below meals:
 
 Acratisma (ἀκράτισμα) 
 Ariston 
 Deipnon 
 Acratisma was the early meal (similar to the ariston of the homeric age), ariston was the middle meal and deipnon was the evening meal (similar to the dorpon of the homeric age). [4] [5] 
 
 Description of the meals [ edit ] 
 Breakfast [ edit ] 
 Breakfast  ( ἀκρατισμός   akratismós  and ἀκράτισμα  akratisma ,  acratisma [6] ) consisted of  barley bread  dipped in wine ( ἄκρατος   ákratos ), sometimes complemented by  figs  or olives. [7]  They also ate a sort of  pancake  called  τηγανίτης   ( tēganítēs ),  ταγηνίτης  ( tagēnítēs ) [8]  or  ταγηνίας  ( tagēnías ), [9]  all words deriving from  τάγηνον  ( tágēnon ), "frying pan". [10]  The earliest attested references on  tagenias  are in the works of the 5th century BC poets  Cratinus [11]  and  Magnes . [12] 
 Tagenites were made with  wheat flour , olive oil,  honey  and  curdled  milk, and were served for breakfast. [13] [14] [15]  Another kind of pancake was  σταιτίτης  ( staititēs ), from  σταίτινος  ( staitinos ), "of flour or dough of  spelt ", [16]  derived from  σταῖς  ( stais ), "flour of spelt". [17]   Athenaeus  in his  Deipnosophistae  mentions  staititas  topped with honey,  sesame  and cheese. [18] [19] [20] 
 
 Lunch [ edit ] 
 A quick  lunch  ( ἄριστον   áriston [21] ) was taken around noon or early afternoon. [22] 
 
 Dinner [ edit ] 
 Dinner  ( δεῖπνον   deīpnon ), the most important meal of the day, was generally taken at nightfall. [22]  An additional light meal ( ἑσπέρισμα   hespérisma ) was sometimes taken in the late afternoon. [22]   Ἀριστόδειπνον  /  aristódeipnon , literally "lunch-dinner", was served in the late afternoon instead of dinner. [23] 
 Epideipnis  (ἐπιδειπνίς) was a second course at dinner. [24] 
 
 Eating customs [ edit ] 
 Men and women took their meals separately. [25]  When the house was small, the men ate first and the women afterwards. [26]  Respect for the father who was the breadwinner was obvious. [27]   Slaves  waited at dinners.  Aristotle  notes that "the poor, having no slaves, would ask their wives or children to serve food."
 The ancient Greek custom of placing  terracotta  miniatures of furniture in children's graves gives a good idea of its style and design. The Greeks normally ate while seated on chairs; benches were used for banquets. [28]  Tables - high for normal meals, low for banquets - were initially rectangular. By the 4th century BC, most tables were round, often with animal-shaped legs (for example lion's paws).
 Loaves of flat bread were occasionally used as plates; terracotta bowls were more common. [29]  Dishes became more refined over time, and by the Roman period plates were sometimes made out of precious metals or glass. Cutlery was not often used at the table. Use of the  fork  was unknown; people ate with their fingers. [30]  Knives were used to cut the meat. [29]  Spoons were used for soups and broths. [29]  Pieces of bread ( ἀπομαγδαλία   apomagdalía ) could be used to spoon the food [30]  or as  napkins  to wipe the fingers. [31] 
 
 Social dining [ edit ] 
 As with modern dinner parties, the host could simply invite friends or family; but two other forms of  social dining  were well documented in ancient Greece: the entertainment of the all-male  symposium , and the obligatory, regimental  syssitia .
 
 Symposium [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Symposium 
   Banqueter playing  kottabos , a playful subversion of the  libation , ca. 510 BC,  Louvre 
 The  symposium  ( συμπόσιον   sympósion ), traditionally translated as "banquet", but more literally "gathering of drinkers", [32]  was one of the preferred pastimes for Greek men. It consisted of two parts: the first dedicated to food, generally rather simple, and a second part dedicated to drinking. [32]  However, wine was consumed with the food, and the beverages were accompanied by snacks ( τραγήματα   tragēmata ) such as  chestnuts ,  beans , toasted wheat, or honey cakes, all intended to absorb alcohol and extend the drinking spree. [33] 
 The second part was inaugurated with a  libation , most often in honor of  Dionysus , [34]  followed by conversation or table games, such as  kottabos . The guests would recline on couches ( κλίναι   klínai ); low tables held the food or game boards.
 Dancers, acrobats, and musicians would entertain the wealthy banqueters. A "king of the banquet" was drawn by lots; he had to direct the slaves as to how strong to mix the wine. [34] 
 With the exception of  courtesans , the banquet was strictly reserved for men. It was an essential element of Greek social life. Great feasts could only be afforded by the rich; in most Greek homes, religious feasts or family events were the occasion of more modest banquets.
 The banquet became the setting of a specific genre of literature, giving birth to  Plato 's  Symposium ,  Xenophon 's work of the same name, the  Table Talk  of  Plutarch 's  Moralia , and the  Deipnosophists  ( Banquet of the Learned ) of  Athenaeus .
 
 Syssitia [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Syssitia 
 The  syssitia  ( τὰ συσσίτια   tà syssítia ) were mandatory meals shared by social or religious groups for men and youths, especially in  Crete  and  Sparta . They were referred to variously as  hetairia ,   pheiditia , or  andreia  (literally, "belonging to men").
 They served as both a kind of aristocratic  club  and as a military  mess .  Like the symposium, the syssitia was the exclusive domain of men – although some references have been found to substantiate all-female  syssitia .  Unlike the symposium, these meals were hallmarked by simplicity and temperance.
 
 Ingredients and dishes [ edit ] 
 First she set for them a fair and well made table that had feet of cyanus; On it there was a vessel of bronze and an onion to give relish to the drink, with honey and cakes of barley meal. —  Homer, Iliad Book XI [35] 
 Grains [ edit ] 
 Breads and cakes [ edit ] 
   Woman kneading  bread , c. 500–475 BC,  National Archaeological Museum of Athens 
 Cereals formed the staple diet. The two main grains were  wheat  ( σῖτος   sītos ) and  barley  ( κριθή   krithē ). [36] 
 When Greece was conquered by Rome during the 3rd century B.C., commercial bakeries were well known and spread. In fact  Pliny the Elder  suggests that the production of bread moved from the family to the “industrial” thanks to the work of skilled artisans (according to Pliny, starting from 171 BC). [37]   Plato  favored home production over commercial production and in  Gorgias , described Thearion the baker as an Athenian novelty who sells goods that could be made at home. [38] 
 In ancient Greece, bread was served with accompaniments known as  opson   ὄψον , sometimes rendered in English as "relish". [39]  This was a generic term which referred to anything which accompanied this staple food, whether meat or fish, fruit or vegetable.
 Cakes may have been consumed for religious reasons as well as secular.  Philoxenus of Cythera  describes in detail some cakes that were eaten as part of an elaborate dinner using the traditional  dithyrambic  style used for sacred  Dionysian  hymns: "mixed with safflower, toasted, wheat-oat-white-chickpea-little thistle-little-sesame-honey-mouthful of everything, with a honey rim".
 Athenaeus  says the  charisios  was eaten at the "all-night festival", but John Wilkins notes that the distinction between the sacred and secular can be blurred in antiquity. [38] 
 Ancient writers mention  melitoutta  ( Ancient Greek :  μελιτοῦττα ), which was a honeycake. [40] [41] 
 
 Wheat [ edit ] 
 Wheat grains were softened by soaking, then either reduced into  gruel , or ground into flour ( ἀλείατα   aleíata ) and kneaded and formed into loaves ( ἄρτος   ártos ) or flatbreads, either plain or mixed with cheese or honey. [42]   Leavening  was known; the Greeks later used an  alkali  ( νίτρον   nítron ) and  wine yeast  as  leavening agents . [43]  Dough loaves were baked at home in a clay oven ( ἰπνός   ipnós ) set on legs. [44] 
 Bread wheat , difficult to grow in Mediterranean climates, and the white bread made from it, were associated with the upper classes in the ancient Mediterranean, while the poor ate coarse brown breads made from  emmer wheat  and  barley . [45] 
 A simpler baking method involved placing lighted coals on the floor and covering the heap with a dome-shaped lid ( πνιγεύς   pnigeús ); when it was hot enough, the coals were swept aside, and dough loaves were placed on the warm floor. The lid was then put back in place, and the coals were gathered on the side of the cover. [46] 
 The stone oven did not appear until the Roman period.  Solon , an  Athenian  lawmaker of the 6th century BC, prescribed that leavened bread be reserved for feast days. [47]  By the end of the 5th century BC, leavened bread was sold at the market, though it was expensive. [48] 
 
 Barley [ edit ] 
 Barley was easier to grow than wheat, but more difficult to make bread from. Barley-based breads were nourishing but very heavy. [49]  Because of this, it was often roasted before being milled into coarse flour ( ἄλφιτα   álphita ). Barley flour was used to make  μᾶζα   maza , the basic Greek dish. Maza could be served cooked or raw, as a broth, or made into dumplings or flatbreads. [42]  Like wheat breads, it could also be augmented with cheese or honey.
 In  Peace ,  Aristophanes  employs the expression  ἐσθίειν κριθὰς μόνας , literally "to eat only barley", with a meaning equivalent to the English "diet of bread and water". [50] 
 
 Millet [ edit ] 
 Millet  was growing wild in Greece as early as 3000 BCE, and bulk storage containers for millet have been found from the  Late Bronze Age  in  Macedonia  and northern Greece. [51]   Hesiod  describes that "the beards grow round the millet, which men sow in summer." [52] [53] 
 Millet is listed along with wheat in the 3rd century BCE by  Theophrastus  in his "Enquiry into Plants" [54] 
 
 Emmer [ edit ] 
 Black bread, made from  emmer  (sometimes called "emmer wheat"), was cheaper (and easier to make) than wheat; it was associated with the lower classes and the poor. [3] 
 
 Legumes [ edit ] 
 Legumes  were essential to the Greek diet, and were harvested in the Mediterranean region from prehistoric times: the earliest and most common being  lentils  - which have been found in archeological sites in Greece dating to the  Upper Paleolithic  period. As one of the first domesticated crops to be introduced to Greece, lentils are commonly found at regional archaeological sites from the Upper Paleolithic. [55] 
 Lentils and chickpeas are the most frequently mentioned legumes in classical literature. [55] 
 
 Bitter vetch [3]  – This plant was present in Greece from at least 8000 BCE, and was occasionally eaten in Classical times. Most ancient literature that mentions it describes it as animal food and having a disagreeable taste. Several classical authors suggest medicinal uses for it. [55] : 378  
 Black beans –  Homer  mentions the threshing a  black bean  (not  black turtle beans ) as a metaphor in the  Iliad [56] 
 Broad beans [3]  – Broad, or Fava Beans are rare in archeological sites, but are common in classical literature. They were eaten both as main dishes and also included in desserts (mixed with figs). In addition to describing them as food, classical authors attribute various medicinal qualities to the beans. [55] : 380  
 Chickpeas [54]  – Chickpeas are mentioned almost as frequently in classical literature as lentils (by  Aristophanes  and  Theophrastus  among others), but are found rarely in archeological sites in Greece. As they are found in prehistoric sites in the Middle East and India, it is likely their use was a late addition to the Ancient Greek diet [55] : 376  
 Grass peas [3]  – Like bitter vetch, grass peas were grown in ancient Greece mainly for animal fodder, however they were occasionally eaten in times of famine  [55] : 381  
 Lentils [54]  –  Theophrastus  states that "of the leguminous plants, the lentil is the most prolific" [57] 
 Lupin bean [54]  – Lupin (or Lupine, Lupini) beans were present in the Mediterranean region from prehistoric times and were cultivated in Egypt by at least 2000 bce. By classical times, the Greeks were using them for both food and animal fodder. [58] 
 Garden peas [3] [59]  – Peas are commonly found in some of the earliest archaeological sites in Greece, but are rarely mentioned in classical literature. However  Hesiod  and Theophrastus both include them as food eaten by Greeks [55] : 381  
 Fruit and vegetables [ edit ] 
 In ancient Greece, fruit and vegetables were a significant part of the diet, as the ancient Greeks consumed much less meat than in the typical diet of modern societies. [60]  Legumes would have been important crops, as their ability to replenish exhausted soil was known at least by the time of  Xenophon . [61] 
 Hesiod  (7th-8th century BCE) describes many crops eaten by the ancient Greeks, among these are artichokes [53]  and peas. [59] 
 Vegetables were eaten as  soups , boiled or mashed ( ἔτνος   etnos ), seasoned with olive oil,  vinegar ,  herbs  or  γάρον   gáron , a fish sauce similar to  Vietnamese   nước mắm . In the  comedies  of Aristophanes,  Heracles  was portrayed as a glutton with a fondness for mashed beans. [62]  Poor families ate oak  acorns  ( βάλανοι   balanoi ). [63]   Olives  were a common appetizer. [64] 
 In the cities, fresh vegetables were expensive, and therefore, the poorer city dwellers had to make do with  dried vegetables . Lentil soup ( φακῆ   phakē ) was the workman's typical dish. [65]  Cheese, garlic, and onions were the soldier's traditional fare. [66]  In Aristophanes'  Peace , the smell of onions typically represents soldiers; the chorus, celebrating the end of war, sings  Oh! joy, joy! No more helmet, no more cheese nor onions! [67]   Bitter vetch  ( ὄροβος   orobos ) was considered a  famine food . [68] 
 Fruits , fresh or dried, and  nuts , were eaten as  dessert . Important fruits were  figs ,  raisins , and  pomegranates . In Athenaeus'  Deipnosophistae , he describes a dessert made of figs and broad beans. [69]  Dried figs were also eaten as an appetizer or when drinking wine. In the latter case, they were often accompanied by grilled  chestnuts ,  chick peas , and  beechnuts .
 
 Animals [ edit ]

 Meat [ edit ] 
   Sacrifice; principal source of meat for city dwellers — here a  boar ; tondo of an  Attic   kylix  by the Epidromos Painter, c. 510–500 BC,  Louvre . 
 In the 8th century BC  Hesiod  describes the ideal country feast in  Works and Days :
 
 But at that time let me have a shady rock and  Bibline wine , a clot of curds and milk of drained goats with the flesh of a heifer fed in the woods, that has never calved, and of firstling kids; then also let me drink bright wine… [70] 
 Meat is much less prominent in texts of the 5th century BC onwards than in the earliest poetry [ citation needed ] , but this may be a matter of genre rather than real evidence of changes in farming and food customs. Fresh meat was most commonly eaten at sacrifices, though sausage was much more common, consumed by people across the economic spectrum. [71]  In addition to the flesh of animals, the ancient Greeks often ate inner organs, many of which were considered delicacies such as  paunches  and  tripe .
 
 But above all I do delight in dishes
 Of paunches and of tripe from gelded beasts,
 
And love a fragrant pig within the oven. —  Hipparchus  (c.190 – c.120 bce),  [72] 
 Hippolochus  (3rd Century BCE) describes a wedding banquet in Macedonia with "chickens and ducks, and ringdoves, too, and a goose, and an abundance of suchlike viands piled high... following which came a second platter of silver, on which again lay a huge loaf, and geese, hares, young goats, and curiously moulded cakes besides, pigeons, turtle-doves, partridges, and other fowl in plenty..." and "a roast pig — a big one, too — which lay on its back upon it; the belly, seen from above, disclosed that it was full of many bounties. For, roasted inside it, were thrushes, ducks, and warblers in unlimited number, pease purée poured over eggs, oysters, and scallops" [1] : 95(129c)  
 Spartans  primarily ate a soup made from pigs' legs and blood, known as  melas zōmos  ( μέλας ζωμός ), which means "black soup". According to Plutarch, it was "so much valued that the elderly men fed only upon that, leaving what flesh there was to the younger". [73]  It was famous amongst the Greeks. "Naturally Spartans are the bravest men in the world," joked a Sybarite, "anyone in his senses would rather die ten thousand times than take his share of such a sorry diet". [74]  It was made with  pork ,  salt ,  vinegar  and blood. [29]  The dish was served with  maza , figs and cheese sometimes supplemented with game and fish. [75]  The 2nd–3rd century author  Aelian  claims that Spartan cooks were prohibited from cooking anything other than meat. [76] 
 The consumption of fish and meat varied in accordance with the wealth and location of the household; in the country,  hunting  (primarily trapping) allowed for consumption of birds and  hares . Peasants also had farmyards to provide them with chickens and geese. Slightly wealthier landowners could raise goats, pigs, or sheep. In the city, meat was expensive except for pork. In Aristophanes' day a piglet cost three drachmas, [77]  which was three days' wages for a public servant. Sausages were common both for the poor and the rich. [78]   Archaeological excavations at  Kavousi Kastro ,  Lerna , and  Kastanas  have shown that dogs were sometimes consumed in Bronze Age Greece, in addition to the more commonly-consumed pigs, cattle, sheep, and goats. [79] 
 
 Fish [ edit ] 
   Fresh fish, one of the favourite dishes of the Greeks, platter with red figures, c. 350–325 BC, Louvre 
 Herodotus describes a "large fish... of the sort called Antacaei, without any prickly bones, and good for pickling," probably  beluga [80]  found in Greek colonies along the  Dnieper River . [81]  Other ancient writers mention  skipjack tuna  (pelamys);  tuna  (thynnoi);  swordfish  (xifiai);  sea raven  (korakinoi);  black carp  (melanes kyprinoi),  porpoise  (phykaina), and  mackerel  (scomber). [80] 
 In the Greek islands and on the coast, fresh fish and seafood ( squid ,  octopus , and  shellfish ) were common. They were eaten locally but more often transported inland.  Sardines  and  anchovies  were regular fare for the citizens of Athens. They were sometimes sold fresh, but more frequently salted. A stele of the late 3rd century BC from the small Boeotian city of  Akraiphia , on  Lake Copais , provides us with a list of fish prices. The cheapest was  skaren  (probably  parrotfish ) whereas  Atlantic bluefin tuna  was three times as expensive. [82]  Common salt water fish were  yellowfin tuna ,  red mullet ,  ray ,  swordfish  or  sturgeon , a delicacy which was eaten salted. Lake Copais itself was famous in all Greece for its  eels , celebrated by the hero of  The Acharnians . Other fresh water fish were  pike-fish ,  carp  and the less appreciated  catfish . In classical Athens, eels, [83]  conger-eels, and sea-perch ( ὈρΦὸς ) were considered to be great delicacies, while  sprats  were cheap and readily available. [84] 
 
 Fowl [ edit ] 
 Ancient Greeks consumed a much wider variety of birds than is typical today. Pheasants were present as early as 2000 BCE. Domestic  chickens  were brought to Greece from Asia Minor as early as 600 BCE, and domesticated  geese  are described in  The Odyssey  (800 BCE).   Quail ,  moorhen ,  capon ,  mallards ,  pheasants ,  larks ,  pigeons and doves  were all domesticated in classical times, and were even for sale in markets. Additionally,  thrush ,  blackbirds ,  chaffinch ,  lark ,  starling ,  jay ,  jackdaw ,  sparrow ,  siskin ,  blackcap ,  Rock partridge ,  grebe ,  plover ,  coot ,  wagtail ,  francolin , and even  cranes  were hunted, or trapped, and eaten, and sometimes available in markets. [85] : 63  
 
 Eggs and dairy products [ edit ] 
 Eggs [ edit ] 
 Greeks bred  quails  and  hens , partly for their  eggs . Some authors also praise  pheasant  eggs and  Egyptian goose  eggs, [86]  which were presumably rather rare. Eggs were cooked  soft- or hard-boiled  as  hors d'œuvre  or  dessert .  Whites ,  yolks  and whole eggs were also used as ingredients in the preparation of dishes. [87] 
 
 Milk [ edit ] 
 Hesiod  describes "milk cake, and milk of goats drained dry" in his  Works and Days . Country dwellers drank  milk  ( γάλα   gala ), but it was seldom used in cooking. [ citation needed ] 
 
 Butter [ edit ] 
 Butter  ( βούτυρον   bouturon ) was known but seldom used: Greeks saw it as a  culinary trait of the  Thracians  of the northern  Aegean  coast, whom the  Middle Comic poet   Anaxandrides  dubbed "butter eaters". [88] 
 
 Cheese and yogurt [ edit ] 
 Cheesemaking  was widespread by the 8th Century BCE, as the technical vocabulary associated with it is included in  The Odyssey . [85] : 66  
 Greeks enjoyed other  dairy products .  Πυριατή   pyriatē  and  Oxygala  ( οξύγαλα ) were curdled milk products, similar to  cottage cheese [89]  or perhaps to  yogurt . [90]  Most of all, goat's and ewe's  cheese  ( τυρός   tyros ) was a staple food. Fresh cheeses (sometimes wrapped in  Drakontion  leaves to retain freshness) and hard cheeses were sold in different shops; the former cost about two thirds of the latter's price. [91] 
 Cheese was eaten alone or with honey or vegetables. It was also used as an ingredient in the preparation of many dishes, including fish dishes (see recipe below by  Mithaecus ). [92]  However, the addition of cheese seems to have been a controversial matter;  Archestratus  warns his readers that Syracusan cooks spoil good fish by adding cheese.
 
 Spices and seasonings [ edit ] 
 The first spice mentioned in Ancient Greek writings is  cassia : [93]   Sappho  (6th-7th Century BCE) mentions it in her poem on the marriage of  Hector  and  Andromache . [94] : 44, ln 30   The ancient Greeks made a distinction between  Ceylon cinnamon  and cassia. [54] 
 Ancient Greeks used at least two forms of pepper in cooking and medicine: [95]  one of Aristotle's students,  Theophrastus , in describing the plants that appeared in Greece as a result of  Alexander's  conquest of India and Asia Minor, [96] 
listed both  black pepper  and  long pepper , stating "one is round like bitter vetch...: the other is elongated and black and has seeds like those of a poppy : and this kind is much stronger than the other. Both however are heating...". [57] 
 Theophrastus lists several plants in his book as "pot herbs" including  dill ,  coriander ,  anise ,  cumin ,  fennel , [97] : 81    rue , [97] : 27    celery  and celery seed. [97] : 125  
 
 Recipes [ edit ] 
 Homer describes the preparation of a wine and cheese drink: taking "Pramnian wine she grated goat's milk cheese into it with a bronze grater [and] threw in a handful of white barley meal." [98]  (Book 11 of the  Iliad )
 One fragment survives of the first known cookbook in any culture, it was written by  Mithaecus  (5th Century BCE) and is quoted in the " Deipnosophistae " of  Athenaeus . It is a recipe for a fish called "tainia" (meaning "ribbon" in Ancient Greek - probably the species  Cepola macrophthalma ), [99] 
 
 "Tainia": gut, discard the head, rinse, slice; add cheese and [olive] oil. [100] 
 Archestratus  (4th Century BCE), the self-titled "inventor of made dishes," [101]  describes a recipe for paunch and tripe, cooked in " cumin  juice, and  vinegar  and sharp, strong-smelling  silphium ". [72] 
 
 Drink [ edit ] 
   Attic   Rhyton , c. 460–450 BC,  National Archaeological Museum of Athens . 
 The most widespread drink was water. Fetching water was a daily task for women. Though wells were common, spring water was preferred: it was recognized as nutritious because it caused plants and trees to grow, [102]  and also as a desirable beverage. [103]   Pindar  called spring water "as agreeable as honey". [104] 
 The Greeks would describe water as robust, [105]  heavy [106]  or light, [107]  dry, [108]  acidic, [109]  pungent, [110]  wine-like, [111]  etc. One of the comic poet  Antiphanes 's characters claimed that he could recognize  Attic  water by taste alone. [112]  Athenaeus states that a number of philosophers had a reputation for drinking nothing but water, a habit combined with a  vegetarian diet  (see  below ). [113]  Milk, usually  goats' milk , was not widely consumed, being considered barbaric.
 The usual drinking vessel was the  skyphos , made out of wood, terra cotta, or metal.  Critias [114]  also mentions the  kothon , a Spartan goblet which had the military advantage of hiding the colour of the water from view and trapping mud in its edge. The ancient Greeks also used a vessel called a  kylix  (a shallow footed bowl), and for banquets the  kantharos  (a deep cup with handles) or the  rhyton , a drinking horn often moulded into the form of a human or animal head.
 
 Wine [ edit ]

   A banqueter reaches into a  krater  with an  oenochoe  to replenish his  kylix  with wine, c. 490–480 BC, Louvre 
 The Greeks are thought to have made  red  as well as  rosé  and  white wines . Like today, these varied in quality from common table wine to valuable vintages. It was generally considered that the best wines came from  Thásos ,  Lesbos  and  Chios . [115] 
 Cretan wine  came to prominence later. A secondary wine made from water and  pomace  (the residue from squeezed grapes), mixed with  lees , was made by country people for their own use. The Greeks sometimes sweetened their wine with honey and made medicinal wines by adding  thyme ,  pennyroyal  and other herbs. By the first century, if not before, they were familiar with wine flavoured with pine resin (modern  retsina ). [116]   Aelian  also mentions a wine mixed with perfume. [117]  Cooked wine was known, [118]  as well as a sweet wine from Thásos, similar to  port wine .
 Wine was generally cut with water. The drinking of  akraton  or "unmixed wine", though known to be practised by northern barbarians, was thought likely to lead to madness and death. [119]  Wine was mixed in a  krater , from which the  slaves  would fill the drinker's kylix with an  oinochoe  (jugs). Wine was also thought to have medicinal powers. Aelian mentions that the wine from Heraia in  Arcadia  rendered men foolish but women fertile; conversely, Achaean wine was thought to induce abortion. [120] 
 Outside of these therapeutic uses, Greek society did not approve of women drinking wine. According to  Aelian , a  Massalian  law prohibited this and restricted women to drinking water. [121]  Sparta was the only city where women routinely drank wine.
 Wine reserved for local use was kept in skins. That destined for sale was poured into  πίθοι   pithoi , (large terra cotta jugs). From there they were decanted into  amphoras  sealed with pitch for retail sale. [122]  Vintage wines carried stamps from the producers or city magistrates who guaranteed their origin. This is one of the first instances of indicating the geographical or qualitative provenance of a product.
 
 Kykeon [ edit ] 
   Hecamede  preparing kykeon for  Nestor , kylix by the  Brygos Painter , ca. 490 BC, Louvre 
 The Greeks also drank  kykeon  ( κυκεών , from  κυκάω   kykaō , "to shake, to mix"), which was both a beverage and a meal. It was a barley gruel, to which water and herbs were added. In the  Iliad , the beverage also contained grated  goat cheese . [123]  In the  Odyssey ,  Circe  adds honey and a magic potion to it. [124]  In the  Homeric Hymn  to  Demeter , the goddess refuses red wine but accepts a kykeon made of water, flour, and  pennyroyal . [125] 
 Used as a ritual beverage in the  Eleusinian Mysteries , kykeon was also a popular beverage, especially in the countryside:  Theophrastus , in his  Characters , describes a boorish peasant as having drunk much kykeon and inconveniencing the  Assembly  with his bad breath. [126]  It also had a reputation as a good digestive, and as such, in  Peace ,  Hermes  recommends it to the main character who has eaten too much dried fruit. [127] 
 
 Ancient writers [ edit ] 
 Timachidas the  Rhodian  wrote 11 books with dinner recipes. Noumenios, Matreas the  Pitanean , Hegemon the  Thasian , who was called Lentil-soup, Artemidoros, who was called the Pseudoaristophanean, and Philoxenos, son of Leukadios, wrote cookbooks. [128] 
 In addition, some flat-cakes took their names from Philoxenos and were called Philoxenean (Φιλοξένειοι πλακοῦντες). [128] 
 Zopyrinus (Ζωπύρινος) was an author of a work on cookery. [129] 
 
 Cultural beliefs about the role of food [ edit ] 
 Food played an important part in the Greek mode of thought. Classicist John Wilkins notes that "in the  Odyssey  for example, good men are distinguished from bad and Greeks from foreigners partly in terms of how and what they ate. Herodotus identified people partly in terms of food and eating". [130] 
 Up to the 3rd century BC, the frugality imposed by the physical and climatic conditions of the country was held as virtuous. The Greeks did not ignore the pleasures of eating, but valued simplicity. The rural writer Hesiod, as cited above, spoke of his "flesh of a heifer fed in the woods, that has never calved, and of firstling kids" as being the perfect closing to a day. Nonetheless,  Chrysippus  is quoted as saying that the best meal was a free one. [131] 
 Culinary  and  gastronomical  research was rejected as a sign of oriental flabbiness: the inhabitants of the  Persian Empire  were considered decadent due to their luxurious taste, which manifested itself in their cuisine. [132]  The Greek authors took pleasure in describing the table of the  Achaemenid  Great King and his court:  Herodotus , [133]   Clearchus of Soli , [134]   Strabo [135]  and  Ctesias [136]  were unanimous in their descriptions.
 In contrast, Greeks as a whole stressed the austerity of their own diet. Plutarch tells how the king of  Pontus , eager to try the Spartan "black gruel", bought a   Laconian  cook; 'but had no sooner tasted it than he found it extremely bad, which the cook observing, told him, "Sir, to make this broth relish, you should have bathed yourself first in the river Eurotas"'. [137]  According to  Polyaenus , [138]  on discovering the dining hall of the Persian royal palace,  Alexander the Great  mocked their taste and blamed it for their defeat.  Pausanias , on discovering the dining habits of the Persian commander  Mardonius , equally ridiculed the Persians, "who having so much, came to rob the Greeks of their miserable living". [139] 
 In consequence of this cult of frugality, and the diminished regard for cuisine it inspired, the kitchen long remained the domain of women, free or enslaved. In the classical period, however, culinary specialists began to enter the written record. Both Aelian [140]  and Athenaeus mention the thousand cooks who accompanied Smindyride of  Sybaris  on his voyage to  Athens  at the time of  Cleisthenes , if only disapprovingly.  Plato  in  Gorgias , mentions "Thearion the cook,  Mithaecus  the author of a treatise on Sicilian cooking, and Sarambos the wine merchant; three eminent connoisseurs of cake, kitchen and wine." [141]  Some chefs also wrote treatises on cuisine.
 Over time, more and more Greeks presented themselves as gourmets. From the   Hellenistic  to the  Roman  period, the Greeks — at least the rich — no longer appeared to be any more austere than others. The cultivated guests of the feast hosted by Athenaeus in the 2nd or 3rd century devoted a large part of their conversation to wine and gastronomy. They discussed the merits of various wines, vegetables, and meats, mentioning renowned dishes (stuffed cuttlefish, red  tuna  belly,  prawns ,  lettuce  watered with mead) and great cooks such as Soterides, chef to king  Nicomedes I  of  Bithynia  (who reigned from the 279 to 250 BC). When his master was inland, he pined for  anchovies ; Soterides simulated them from carefully carved turnips, oiled, salted and sprinkled with poppy seeds. [142]   Suidas  (an encyclopaedia from the  Byzantine  period) mistakenly attributes this exploit to the celebrated Roman gourmet  Apicius  (1st century BC) — [143]   which may be taken as evidence that the Greeks had reached the same level as the Romans.
 
 Specific diets [ edit ] 
 Vegetarianism [ edit ] 
   Triptolemus  received wheat sheaves from  Demeter  and blessings from  Persephone , 5th century BC relief,  National Archaeological Museum of Athens 
 Orphicism  and  Pythagoreanism , two common  ancient Greek religions , suggested a different way of life, based on a concept of purity and thus purification ( κάθαρσις   katharsis ) — a form of asceticism in the original sense:  ἄσκησις   askēsis  initially signifies a ritual, then a specific way of life.  Vegetarianism  was a central element of Orphicism and of several variants of Pythagoreanism.
 Empedocles  (5th century BC) justified vegetarianism by a belief in the transmigration of souls: who could guarantee that an animal about to be slaughtered did not house the soul of a human being? However, it can be observed that Empedocles also included plants in this transmigration, thus the same logic should have applied to eating them. [144]  Vegetarianism was also a consequence of a dislike for killing: "For Orpheus taught us rights and to refrain from killing". [145] 
 The information from  Pythagoras  (6th century BC) is more difficult to define. The  Comedic  authors such as  Aristophanes  and  Alexis  described  Pythagoreans  as strictly vegetarian, with some of them living on bread and water alone. Other traditions contented themselves with prohibiting the consumption of certain vegetables, such as the broad bean, [146]  or of sacred animals such as the white  cock  or selected animal parts.
 It follows that vegetarianism and the idea of ascetic purity were closely associated, and often accompanied by  sexual abstinence . In  On the eating of flesh ,  Plutarch  (1st–2nd century) elaborated on the barbarism of blood-spilling; inverting the usual terms of debate, he asked the meat-eater to justify his choice. [147] 
 The  Neoplatonic   Porphyrius  (3rd century) associates in  On Abstinence  vegetarianism with the   Cretan   mystery cults , and gives a census of past vegetarians, starting with the semi-mythical  Epimenides . For him, the origin of vegetarianism was  Demeter 's gift of wheat to  Triptolemus  so that he could teach agriculture to humanity.  His three commandments were: "Honour your parents", "Honour the gods with fruit", and "Spare the animals". [148] 
 
 Athlete diets [ edit ] 
 Aelian claims that the first athlete to submit to a formal diet was Ikkos of Tarentum, a victor in the Olympic pentathlon (perhaps in 444 BC). [149]  However, Olympic wrestling champion (62nd through 66th Olympiads)  Milo of Croton  was already said to eat twenty pounds of meat and twenty pounds of bread and to drink eight quarts of wine each day. [150]  Before his time, athletes were said to practice  ξηροφαγία   xērophagía  (from  ξηρός   xēros , "dry"), a diet based on dry foods such as dried figs, fresh cheese and bread. [151]  Pythagoras (either the philosopher or a gymnastics master of the same name) was the first to direct athletes to eat meat. [152] 
 Trainers later enforced some standard diet rules: to be an Olympic victor,  "you have to eat according to regulations, keep away from desserts (…); you must not drink cold water nor can you have a drink of wine whenever you want". [153]  It seems this diet was primarily based on meat, for  Galen  (ca. 180 AD) accused athletes of his day of "always gorging themselves on flesh and blood". [154]  Pausanias also refers to a "meat diet". [155]
