 Culinary traditions of Ivory Coast 
   Location of  Ivory Coast 
 Ivorian cuisine  is the traditional cuisine of  Côte d'Ivoire , or the Ivory Coast, and is based on  tubers ,  grains ,  pig ,  chicken ,  seafood ,  fish , fresh  fruits ,  vegetables  and  spices . It is very similar to that of neighboring countries in West Africa. Common  staple foods  include grains and tubers. Côte d'Ivoire is one of the largest  cocoa  producers in the world and also produces  palm oil  and  coffee .
 
 
 Common foods and dishes [ edit ] 
   Raw  cassava 
 Cassava  and  plantains  are significant parts of Ivorian cuisine. A  corn  paste called  aitiu  is used to prepare corn balls, and  peanuts  are widely used in dishes.  Attiéké  is a popular side dish in Côte d'Ivoire made with grated cassava and is very similar in taste and consistency to  couscous . [1]  A common street-vended food is  alloco , which is ripe plantain banana fried in  palm oil , spiced with a spicy sauce made of onions and chili. [1]  It can be eaten alone as a snack or often with a hard-boiled egg, as well as a side dish.
 Grilled fish and grilled chicken are the most popular non-vegetarian foods. Lean, low-fat Guinea fowl, which is popular in the region, is commonly referred as  poulet bicyclette . Seafood includes  tuna ,  sardines ,  shrimp  and  bonito . Smoked fish is also common, as it is all over West Africa. [2] 
 
   Ivorian snails 
 Maafe  (pronounced "mafeh") is a common dish consisting of meat in a  peanut sauce . [3] 
 Slow-simmered  stews  with various ingredients are another common food staple in Côte d'Ivoire. [3]   Kedjenou  is a spicy stew consisting of chicken and vegetables that are slow-cooked in a sealed pot [4] [5]  with little or no added liquid. This concentrates the flavors of the chicken and vegetables and tenderizes the chicken. [3]  It is usually cooked in a pottery jar called a  canari , over a low fire, or cooked in an oven. [3] 
 Cow's foot is an ingredient "in everything", [2]  skin on, boiled for hours into a jelly.
 Ivorian land snails are huge and very appreciated, commonly grilled or eaten in sauce.
 
 Fruits and vegetables [ edit ] 
   Alloco  (fried banana) 
   Riz graz 
 Widely consumed fruits include  mandarins ,  mango ,  passionfruit ,  soursops  and  coconuts .  Eggplant  is a commonly used vegetable in many dishes. [3]   Foufou  is a dish consisting of mashed plantains and palm oil, whereas  foutou  is made from mashed  plantains  and yam. [3]   Foutu banane , beaten until stretchy to the touch, might be matched with and used to eat  sauce graine , palm nuts crushed into paste topped with bright red oil. [2] 
 
   Foutu banane 
 Gombo frais  (fresh okra) is a stew of tomato pieces, palm oil and okra chopped together. [2]  It might be served with a side dish of  alloco  (fried plantains), or  riz gras  (fatty rice), an Ivorian version of the West African  jollof  rice in which the fattened grains are "cooked in a soup that's built from onions fried into a sugary sweat and simmered with garlic, fresh tomatoes and tomato paste, for layers of bright and dark." [2] 
 Attiéké , "fermented cassava pulp grated and molded into tiny couscous-like orbs" has a bland taste but can be served with  Scotch peppers  or  Maggi   bouillon . [2] 
 
 Beverages [ edit ] 
 Bangui  is a local  palm wine .  Gnamakoudji  is pulped ginger squeezed through cheese cloth then mellowed with pineapple juice, lemon and vanilla. [2]   Nyamanku  is a local non-alcoholic beverage made from ground  ginger  root mixed with the juices of oranges, pineapples, and lemons.
 
 Maquis restaurants [ edit ] 
 Ivorians have a kind of small, open-air  restaurant  called a  maquis , unique to Côte d'Ivoire.  Maquis  normally feature braised  chicken  and  fish  served with  onions  and  tomatoes ,  attiéké  or  kedjenou .
