 Cuisine consisting of a combination of several culinary traditions 
   Gobi Manchurian  is an  Indian–Chinese fusion dish , consisting of fried  cauliflower . The dish is popular throughout  India  and  Indian restaurants  as well as South Asian restaurants around the world. 
   Example of a fusion dish: combination of  smoked salmon  wrapped in  rice paper , with  avocado ,  cucumber  and  crab sticks 
 Fusion cuisine  is  cuisine  that combines elements of different  culinary traditions  that originate from different countries, regions, or cultures. They can occur naturally and become aspects of culturally relevant cuisines, [1]  or they can be part of the post-1970s movement for contemporary restaurant innovations. [2] 
 The term fusion cuisine, added to the  Oxford English Dictionary  in 2002, is defined as "a style of cookery which blends ingredients and methods of preparation from different countries, regions, or ethnic groups; food cooked in this style." [3] 
 
 
 Categories [ edit ] 
   Pancit palabok  in  Filipino cuisine , combines  rice noodles  and  tofu  from  China  with native  smoked fish  flakes in a shrimp sauce dyed bright orange with  annatto  seeds from  Mexico  and garnished with crushed  chicharon  from  Spain . It is served spritzed with native  calamansi . 
 Fusion food is created by combining various cooking techniques for different cultures to produce a new type of food. Although it is commonly invented by chefs, fusion cuisine can occur naturally within the different cuisines of a region or sub-region. These can include larger regions, such as  East Asian cuisine ,  European cuisine , and  Southwestern American cuisine , as well as more specific and lauded  ethnic cuisines  such as  Chinese cuisine ,  Japanese cuisine ,  Korean cuisine ,  French cuisine ,  Italian cuisine , and  New Mexican cuisine .
 Chefs within Asian fusion  restaurants  combine the various cuisines of different Asian countries, have become popular in many parts of the United States and United Kingdom. Often featured are  East Asian ,  Southeast Asian , and  South Asian  dishes alongside one another and offering dishes that are inspired combinations of such cuisines. [4]   California cuisine  is considered a fusion culture, taking inspiration particularly from  Italy ,  France ,  Mexico , the idea of the European  delicatessen , and East Asia, and then creating traditional dishes from these cultures with non-traditional ingredients - such as  California pizza . One major example is  Oceanic cuisine , which combines the different cuisines of the various  island nations . [5]  In the  United Kingdom ,  fish and chips  can be seen as an early fusion dish due to its marrying of ingredients stemming from  Jewish ,  French , and  Belgian  cuisines. [6] [7]   Filipino cuisine  is also sometimes characterized as the "original Asian fusion cuisine", combining native culinary traditions and ingredients with the very different cuisines of  Spain ,  Mexico ,  China , and the  United States , among others, due to its unique  colonial history . [8] 
 In Australia, due to the increasing influx of migrants, fusion cuisine is being reinvented and is becoming increasingly the norm at numerous cafes and restaurants, with  Modern Australian  Asian-fusion restaurants like  Tetsuya's  in Sydney ranking highly in  The World's 50 Best Restaurants .  Another incarnation of fusion cuisine implements a more  eclectic  approach, which generally features original dishes that combine varieties of ingredients from various cuisines and regions. Such a restaurant might feature a wide variety of dishes inspired by a combination of various regional cuisines with new ideas. [9]   Foods  in  Malaysia  (also  Indonesia ) are another popular example of fusion cuisine between  Malay ,  Javanese ,  Chinese  and  Indian  and light influences from  Thai ,  Portuguese ,  Dutch , and  British cuisines . [10] 
 
 Types [ edit ] 
 Another form of fusion food can be created by utilizing ingredients and flavors from one culture to create a unique twist on a dish from the different cultures. For example, a  taco pizza  is a type of  pizza  created using  taco  ingredients such as  cheddar  and  pepper jack cheese ,  salsa ,  refried beans , and other common taco ingredients, fusing both Italian and Mexican cuisines. [11] 
 Similar approaches have been used for  fusion sushi , such as rolling  maki  with different types of rice and ingredients such as  curry  and  basmati  rice, cheese and salsa with  Spanish rice , or spiced ground  lamb  and  capers  rolled with Greek-style rice and grape leaves, which resembles inside-out  dolmades . Some fusion cuisines have themselves become accepted as a national cuisine, as with  Peruvian Nikkei  cuisine, which combines Japanese spices and seasonings and Peruvian ingredients like  ají  with seafood. A quintessential Peruvian Nikkei dish is "maki acevichado" or "ceviche roll", consisting of  ceviche  with  avocado  rolled into maki. [12] 
 Saudi Arabia has been investing in resources to preserve their culture. In  Jeddah , different cultures from Africa and Asia have used the combination of Saudi Arabia's spices to create new fusion foods found throughout the region and the country. [13] 
 
 History [ edit ] 
   Kaeng phet pet yang  (Thai roast duck curry) is an example of early fusion cuisine of the  cosmopolitan  court of the  Ayutthaya Kingdom , combining  Thai  red curry, Chinese roast duck, and grapes originally from  Persia 
   Traditional Ethiopian cuisine blended with Texas-style barbeque, including pork, smoked brisket, and  Texas toast 
 Fusion cuisine has existed for millennia as a form of cross-cultural exchange, though the term was only defined in the late 1900s. Mixtures of different cultures' cuisines have been adapted since the 16th century. A number of these (though not all) have resulted from  colonialism , such as  bánh mì  originating from French ingredients used in  French Indochina ,  Jamaican patties  combining the  turnover  with spices and peppers from the  British Empire 's possessions in Asia and Africa, and  ramen  originating as " shina soba " or "Chinese noodle" from the  Empire of Japan 's occupation of  China 's island territories in the late 1800s and early 1900s. [14] [15] 
 Japanese cooking techniques were combined with French techniques in 1970s France to create  nouvelle cuisine . [16] 
 Wolfgang Puck  is attributed as one of the pioneers of fusion cuisine, with some dispute. [14]  However, his restaurant  Chinois on Main  was named after the term attributed to Richard Wing, who in the 1960s combined French and Chinese cooking at the former  Imperial Dynasty  restaurant in  Hanford, California . [17] 
 Chef  Norman Van Aken  was the first person to use the term "fusion cooking" as he delivered a speech at a symposium in Santa Fe in 1988. Soon journalist Regina Schrambling wrote about Van Aken's work and the term spread around the globe. [18]  Norman Van Aken ended his speech by discussing the history of fusion cuisine, such as the use of coffee in Italian cuisine. [19]  Van Aken related this to  coffee  being used in different desserts such as Calabrian  ricotta  with chocolate  mousse . [20]
