   Map showing major regional cuisines of China 
 Cantonese  or  Guangdong cuisine , also known as  Yue cuisine  ( Chinese :  廣東菜  or  粵菜 ) is the  cuisine  of  Guangdong province  of China, particularly the provincial capital  Guangzhou , and the surrounding regions in the  Pearl River Delta  including  Hong Kong  and  Macau . [1]  Strictly speaking, Cantonese cuisine is the cuisine of  Guangzhou  or of  Cantonese  speakers, but it often includes the cooking styles of all the speakers of  Yue Chinese  languages in Guangdong. Scholars categorize Guangdong cuisine into three major groups based on the region's dialect: Cantonese, Hakka and Chaozhou cuisines. [2] 
 The  Teochew cuisine  and  Hakka cuisine  of Guangdong are considered their own styles, as is neighboring  Guangxi 's  cuisine  despite eastern Guangxi being considered  culturally Cantonese  due to the presence of  ethnic Zhuang  influences in the rest of the province. Cantonese cuisine is one of the Eight Culinary Traditions of  Chinese cuisine . Its prominence outside China is due to the large number of  Cantonese   emigrants . Chefs trained in Cantonese cuisine are highly sought after throughout China. [3]  Until the late 20th century, most Chinese restaurants in the West served largely Cantonese dishes.

 Guangzhou (Canton) City , the provincial capital of  Guangdong  and the centre of  Cantonese culture , has long been a trading hub and many imported foods and ingredients are used in Cantonese cuisine. Besides pork, beef and chicken, Cantonese cuisine incorporates almost all edible meats, including  offal , chicken feet, duck's tongue,  frog legs , snakes and snails. [ citation needed ]  However, lamb and goat are less commonly used than in the cuisines of northern or western China. Many cooking methods are used, with  steaming  and  stir-frying  being the most favoured due to their convenience and rapidity. Other techniques include  shallow frying ,  double steaming ,  braising  and  deep frying .
 Compared to other Chinese regional cuisines, the flavours of most traditional Cantonese dishes should be well-balanced and not greasy. Apart from that, spices should be used in modest amounts to avoid overwhelming the flavours of the primary ingredients, and these ingredients in turn should be at the peak of their freshness and quality. [4]  There is no widespread use of fresh  herbs  in Cantonese cooking, in contrast with their liberal use in other cuisines such as  Sichuanese ,  Vietnamese ,  Lao ,  Thai  and  European .  Garlic chives  and  coriander  leaves are notable exceptions, although the former are often used as a vegetable and the latter are usually used as mere garnish in most dishes.
 
 Foods [ edit ] 
 Sauces and condiments [ edit ] 
 In Cantonese cuisine, ingredients such as  sugar ,  salt ,  soy sauce ,  rice wine ,  corn starch ,  vinegar ,  scallion  and  sesame oil  suffice to enhance flavour, although garlic is heavily used in some dishes, especially those in which internal organs, such as entrails, may emit unpleasant odours.  Ginger ,  chili peppers ,  five-spice powder , powdered  black pepper ,  star anise  and a few other spices are also used, but often sparingly.

 Dried and preserved ingredients [ edit ] 
 Although Cantonese cooks pay much attention to the freshness of their primary ingredients, Cantonese cuisine also uses a long list of preserved food items to add flavour to a dish. This may be influenced by  Hakka cuisine , since the  Hakkas  were once a dominant group occupying  imperial Hong Kong  and other southern territories.
 Some items gain very intense flavours during the  drying / preservation / oxidation  process and some foods are preserved to increase their shelf life. Some chefs combine both dried and fresh varieties of the same items in a dish. Dried items are usually soaked in water to  rehydrate  before cooking. These ingredients are generally not served  a la carte , but rather with vegetables or other Cantonese dishes.

 Traditional dishes [ edit ] 
 A number of dishes have been part of Cantonese cuisine since the earliest territorial establishments of Guangdong. While many of these are on the menus of typical  Cantonese restaurants , some simpler ones are more commonly found in Cantonese homes. Home-made Cantonese dishes are usually served with plain  white rice .

 Deep fried dishes [ edit ] 
 There are a small number of deep-fried dishes in Cantonese cuisine, which can often be found as  street food . They have been extensively documented in  colonial Hong Kong  records of the 19th and 20th centuries. A few are synonymous with Cantonese breakfast and lunch, [6]  even though these are also part of other cuisines.

 Soups [ edit ] 
 Old fire soup, or  lou fo tong  ( 老火汤 ;  老火湯 ;  lǎohuǒ tāng ;  lou5 fo2 tong ; 'old fire-cooked soup'), is a clear  broth  prepared by simmering meat and other ingredients over a low heat for several hours. Chinese herbs are often used as ingredients. There are basically two ways to make old fire soup – put ingredients and water in the pot and heat it directly on fire, which is called  bou tong  ( 煲汤 ;  煲湯 ;  bāo tāng ;  bou1 tong1 ); or put the ingredients in a small stew pot, and put it in a bigger pot filled with water, then heat the bigger pot on fire directly, which is called  dun tong  ( 燉汤 ;  燉湯 ;  dùn tāng ;  dun6 tong1 ). The latter way can keep the most original taste of the soup.
 Soup chain stores or delivery outlets in cities with significant Cantonese populations, such as Hong Kong, serve this dish due to the long preparation time required of slow-simmered soup.

 Seafood [ edit ] 
   Seafood tanks in a Cantonese restaurant 
 Due to Guangdong's location along the  South China Sea  coast, fresh seafood is prominent in Cantonese cuisine, and many Cantonese restaurants keep aquariums or seafood tanks on the premises. In Cantonese cuisine, as in cuisines from other parts of Asia, if seafood has a repugnant odour, strong spices and marinating juices are added; the freshest seafood is odourless and, in Cantonese culinary arts, is best cooked by steaming. For instance, in some recipes, only a small amount of  soy sauce ,  ginger  and  spring onion  is added to steamed fish. In Cantonese cuisine, the light seasoning is used only to bring out the natural sweetness of the seafood. As a rule of thumb, the spiciness of a dish is usually negatively correlated to the freshness of the ingredients.

 Little pot rice [ edit ] 
   Little pot chicken rice with vegetable and  Chinese sausage 
 Little pot rice ( 煲仔饭 ;  煲仔飯 ;  bāozǎifàn ;  bou1 zai2 faan6 ) are dishes cooked and served in a flat-bottomed pot (as opposed to a round-bottomed  wok ). Usually this is a  saucepan  or  braising  pan (see  clay pot cooking ). Such dishes are cooked by covering and steaming, making the rice and ingredients very hot and soft. Usually the ingredients are layered on top of the rice with little or no mixing in between. Many standard combinations exist.

 Banquet/dinner dishes [ edit ] 
 A number of dishes are traditionally served in Cantonese restaurants only at dinner time.  Dim sum  restaurants stop serving  bamboo -basket dishes after the  yum cha  period (equivalent to  afternoon tea ) and begin offering an entirely different menu in the evening. Some dishes are standard while others are regional. Some are customised for special purposes such as  Chinese marriages  or banquets. Salt and pepper dishes are one of the few spicy dishes.

 Dessert [ edit ] 
 After the evening meal, most Cantonese restaurants offer  tong sui  ( 糖水 ;  táng shuǐ ;  tong4 seoi2 ; 'sugar water'), a sweet soup. Many varieties of  tong sui  are also found in other Chinese cuisines. Some desserts are traditional, while others are recent innovations. The more expensive restaurants usually offer their specialty desserts. Sugar water is the general name of dessert in Guangdong province. It is cooked by adding water and sugar to some other cooking ingredients.

 Delicacies [ edit ] 
 Certain Cantonese delicacies consist of parts taken from rare or endangered animals, which raises controversy over  animal rights  and  environmental issues . This is often [ according to whom? ]  due to alleged health benefits of certain animal products. For example, the continued spreading of the idea that  shark cartilage  can cure cancer has led to decreased shark populations even though scientific research has found no evidence to support the credibility of shark cartilage as a cancer cure. [7]
