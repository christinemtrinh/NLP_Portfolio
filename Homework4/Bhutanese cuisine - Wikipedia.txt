 Bhutanese cuisine  ( Dzongkha : འབྲུག་ཟས་;  Wylie :  brug-zas ) employs much  red rice  (like  brown rice  in texture, but with a nutty taste, the only variety of  rice  that grows at  high altitudes ),  buckwheat , and increasingly  maize .
 
 
 Regional cuisines [ edit ] 
 Buckwheat is eaten mainly in Bumthang, maize in the Eastern districts, and rice elsewhere. The diet in the hills also includes  chicken ,  yak  meat, dried  beef ,  pork , pork fat, and  lamb . Soups and stews of  meat , rice,  ferns ,  lentils , and dried  vegetables , spiced with  chili peppers  and  cheese , are a favorite meal during the cold seasons.  Zow shungo  is a rice dish mixed with leftover vegetables.  Ema datshi  is a spicy dish made with large, green chili peppers in a cheesy sauce (similar to  chile con queso ), which might be called the  national dish  for its ubiquity and the pride that  Bhutanese  have for it. [1]  Other foods include  jasha maru  (a chicken dish),  phaksha paa  (dried pork cooked with chili peppers,  spices , and vegetables, including  turnips ,  greens , or  radishes ),  thukpa ,  puta  (buckwheat noodles),  bathup , and  fried rice .
 
 Snacks [ edit ] 
 Popular snacks include  momo  (Bhutanese dumplings),  shakam eezay [ check spelling ] ,  khabzey  (dried  fritters  made with  flour , water, and  sugar , which are then deep-fried),  shabalay ,  juma  (Bhutanese  sausages  marinated in spices), and  noodles .
 
 Foreign influences [ edit ] 
 Restaurants in the country can serve  Chinese ,  Nepalese ,  Tibetan  and  Indian  foods, which are very popular and in recent years  Korean  restaurants have opened due to the increasing popularity of  Korean popular culture  in the country. [2] 
 
 Dairy and beverages [ edit ] 
 Dairy  foods, particularly  butter  and cheese from  yaks  and  cows , are also popular, and indeed almost all milk is turned into butter and cheese. Cheese made from cow's milk called  datshi  is never eaten raw, but used to make sauces.  Zoedoe  is another type of cheese made in the Eastern districts, which is added to soups. Zoedoe is normally greenish in color and has a strong smell. Other types of cheese include Western types like  Cheddar  and  Gouda . Western cheese is made in the Swiss Cheese Factory in Bumthang or imported from  India . Popular beverages include  butter tea  prepared using tea leaves, salt and butter (called  suja ),  milk tea  (called  ngaja ),  black tea , locally brewed  ara  ( rice wine ), and  beer . Spices include  curry ,  cardamom ,  ginger ,  thingay  ( Sichuan pepper ),  garlic ,  turmeric , and  caraway .
