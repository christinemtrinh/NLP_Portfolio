   Tamales  are a  traditional food  eaten in  Guatemala  on special occasions, especially during  Christmas  time and other holidays. They are pouches of  masa  usually filled with meat, such as  pork  and  chicken , but can also be filled with vegetables such as  corn  and  potatoes , and are usually wrapped in corn husks. 
 Most  traditional foods  in  Guatemalan cuisine  are based on  Maya cuisine , with  Spanish  influence, and prominently feature  corn ,  chilies  and  beans  as key ingredients. Guatemala is famously home to the Hass avocado. [1] 
 There are also foods that are commonly eaten on certain days of the week. For example, it is a popular custom to eat  paches  (a kind of  tamale  made from potatoes) on Thursday. Certain dishes are also associated with special occasions, such as  fiambre  for  All Saints Day  on November 1 and tamales, which are common around  Christmas .
 
 
 History [ edit ] 
 Regional Guatemalan cuisine is relatively obscure, due in part to its geographic isolation in volcanic highlands, and also due to the  civil war  in the second half of the 20th century which discouraged international visitors. Guatemalan cuisine is heavily influenced by Mayan cuisine, with some Spanish influences as well. Many dishes are hyper-regional and are not available outside specific towns. [2] 
 Maize  is an important staple food in Guatemalan cuisine, and has been cultivated in the region since ancient times. Hot chocolate also has a long history in Guatemala. Before the modern era, chocolate was seen as a luxury, and cocoa beans were also used as currency by ancient Mayans. Pork and beef were later introduced by Spanish colonization in the 16th century, supplementing the local meat sources of turkey, other poultry, and fish. [2] 
 
 Style [ edit ] 
 Many Guatemalan dishes are cooked without the use of  cooking oil , with ingredients placed directly on the  comal  or wrapped in leaves. Many Guatemalan dishes have the suffix '-ik' as part of their name; -ik means chili in several  Mayan languages  spoken in the country. [2] 
 
 Varieties of Guatemalan tamales [ edit ] 
   Black and red  tamales  in Guatemala 
 There are reportedly hundreds of varieties of tamales throughout Guatemala. The key variations include the ingredients in the  masa  or dough (corn, potatoes, rice), in the filling (meat, fruits, nuts), and what it is wrapped with (leaves, husks). Tamales in Guatemala tend to be wrapped in green 'maxan' leaves ( Calathea lutea ), while  chuchitos  — which resemble Mexican tamales — are wrapped in  corn husks .
 The  masa  is made out of corn that is not sweet, such as what is known as feed corn in the United States. In Guatemala, this non-sweet corn is called  maize  and the corn that Americans are used to eating on the cob (sweet corn), Guatemalans call  elote . Tamales in Guatemala are more typically wrapped in  plantain  or  banana  leaves and  maxan  leaves than corn husks. Additionally Guatemalan tamales use cooked  masa , which is prepared in a time-consuming process that requires a significant amount of work.
 
 Tamales colorados  ("red tamales") owe their name to the tomato and  achiote  (annatto seed) that give them their color, wrapped with corn masa and are stuffed with tomato  recado  (a flavorful thick sauce), roasted red bell pepper strips, capers, green olives, and chicken, beef or pork. 
 Tamales negros  ("black tamales") are darker and sweeter than their red counterparts due to the chocolate, raisins, prunes and almonds which are added to them. Other black tamales are not sweet but are simply made out of blue/black corn. 
 Tamales de elote  ("sweet corn tamales") do not use the typical  masa  but instead are made out of sweet corn. These may contain whole kernels of corn in the masa and do not generally contain meat. 
 Chuchitos  ("small dogs") are a very typical kind of Guatemalan tamale made using the same corn  masa  as a regular tamale but they are smaller, have a much firmer consistency and are wrapped in a  tuzas  (dried corn husks) instead of plantain leaves.  Chuchitos  are often accompanied by a simple tomato  salsa  and sprinkled with a hard, salty white cheese traditional from the  Zacapa  region. Chuchitos are a very common and are commonly served at luncheons, dinners and celebrations. The masa can be mixed with tomato recado or with a meat broth. 
 Tamalitos de masa  ("small dough tamales") are smaller than the typical tamales because they are usually plain in taste, with no filling and are used to dip in other foods such as soup,  salsa  or beans, rather than eaten alone. These tamales are a staple of western Guatemalan cuisine which are favored over the typical tortilla. 
 Tamalitos de  chipilín  and  tamales de  loroco  are other variants of the aforementioned  tamales de masa , that have said ingredients added to the mix. 
 Paches  are a kind of tamal made from potatoes instead of corn.
