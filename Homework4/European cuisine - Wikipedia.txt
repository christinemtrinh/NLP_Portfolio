 Cuisine indigenous to Europe 
   Spanish  crème caramel 
   French  baguette 
   Italian  pasta 
 European cuisine  comprises the  cuisines  of  Europe [1] [2]  including the cuisines brought to other countries by European settlers and colonists. Sometimes the term "European", or more specifically "continental" cuisine, is used to refer more strictly to the cuisine of the  western parts  of  mainland  Europe.

 The cuisines of Western countries are diverse, although there are common characteristics that distinguish them from those of other regions. [3]  Compared with  traditional cooking of East Asia , meat is more prominent and substantial in serving size. [4]   Bread ,  cured meat ,  cheese ,  steak  and  cutlets  in particular are common dishes across the West. [ dubious    –  discuss ]  Western cuisines also emphasize  grape wine [ dubious    –  discuss ]  and sauces as condiments, seasonings, or accompaniments (in part due to the difficulty of seasonings penetrating the often larger pieces of meat used in Western cooking). Many dairy products are utilised in cooking. [5]  There are hundreds of varieties of  cheese  and other  fermented milk products . White  wheat -flour bread has long been the prestige  starch , but historically, most people ate bread, flatcakes, or  porridge  made from  rye ,  spelt ,  barley , and  oats . [6] [7]  Those better-off would also make  pasta ,  dumplings  and  pastries . The  potato  has become a major starch plant in the diet of Europeans and their diaspora since the  European colonisation of the Americas .  Maize  is much less common in most European diets than it is in the  Americas ; however, corn meal ( polenta  or  mămăligă ) is a major part of the cuisine of  Italy  and the  Balkans . Although flatbreads (especially with toppings such as  pizza  or  tarte flambée ) and rice are eaten in Europe, they are only staple foods in limited areas, particularly in Southern Europe.   Salads  (cold dishes with uncooked or cooked vegetables, sometimes with a dressing) are an integral part of European cuisine.
 Formal European dinners are served in distinct courses. European presentation evolved from  service à la française , or bringing multiple dishes to the table at once, into  service à la russe , where dishes are presented sequentially. Usually, cold, hot and savoury, and sweet dishes are served strictly separately in this order, as  hors d'oeuvre  (appetizer) or soup, as  entrée  and  main course , and as  dessert . Dishes that are both sweet and savoury were common earlier in Ancient Roman cuisine, but are today uncommon, with sweet dishes being served only as dessert. A service where the guests are free to take food by themselves is termed a  buffet , and is usually restricted to parties or holidays. Nevertheless, guests are expected to follow the same pattern.
 Historically, European cuisine has been developed in the European royal and noble courts. European nobility was usually arms-bearing and lived in separate manors in the countryside. The knife was the primary eating implement ( cutlery ), and eating steaks and other foods that require cutting followed. This contrasted with East Asian cuisine, where the ruling class were the court officials, who had their food prepared ready to eat in the kitchen, to be eaten with  chopsticks . The knife was supplanted by the  spoon  for soups, while the  fork  was introduced later in the  early modern period , ca. 16th century. Today, most dishes are intended to be eaten with cutlery and only a few  finger foods  can be eaten with the hands in polite company.

 Medieval [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Medieval cuisine In medieval times, a person's diet varied depending on their  social class . Cereal grains made up a lot of a medieval person's diet, regardless of social class.  Bread  was common to both classes- it was taken as a  lunch  for the working man, and thick slices of it were used as plates called trenchers. [8]  People of the noble class had access to finely ground flours for their breads and other baked goods. Noblemen were allowed to hunt for deer, boar, rabbits, birds, and other animals, giving them access to fresh meat and fish for their meals. [9]  Dishes for people of these classes were often heavily spiced. [10]   Spices  at that time were very expensive, and the more spices used in dishes, the more wealth the person had to be able to purchase such ingredients. Common spices used were  cinnamon ,  ginger ,  nutmeg , pepper,  cumin ,  cloves ,  turmeric ,  anise , and  saffron . [11]  Other ingredients used in dishes for the nobility and clergy included  sugar ,  almonds  and dried fruits like  raisins . [12]  These imported ingredients would have been very expensive and nearly impossible for commoners to obtain. When banquets were held, the dishes served would be very spectacular- another way for the noblemen to show how rich they were. Sugar sculptures would be placed on the tables as decoration and to eat, and foods would be dyed vibrant colors with imported spices. [13] 
 The diet of a commoner would have been much more simple. Strict  poaching  laws prevented them from hunting, and if they did hunt and were caught, they could have parts of their limbs cut off or they could be killed. [14]  Much of the commoners food would have been preserved in some way, such as through  pickling  or by being salted. [15]  Breads would have been made using  rye  or  barley , and any vegetables would likely have been grown by the commoners themselves. [16]  Peasants would have likely been able to keep cows, and so would have access to milk, which then allowed them to make butter or cheese. [17]  When meat was eaten, it would have been beef, pork, or lamb. Commoners also ate a dish called  pottage , a thick stew of vegetables, grains, and meat. [18] 
 
 Early modern era [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Early modern European cuisine 
 In the  early modern era , European cuisine saw an influx of new ingredients due to the  Columbian Exchange , such as the potato, tomato, eggplant, chocolate, bell pepper, pumpkins, and other squash. Distilled spirits, along with tea, coffee, and chocolate were all popularized during this time. In the 1780s, the idea of the modern restaurant was introduced in Paris; the French Revolution accelerated its development, quickly spreading around Europe.
 
 Central European cuisines [ edit ]

 All of these countries have their specialities. [19]  Austria is famous for  Wiener Schnitzel  - a breaded veal cutlet served with a slice of lemon, the Czech Republic for world renowned beers. Germany for world-famous wursts, Hungary for goulash. Slovakia is famous for gnocchi-like Halusky pasta. Slovenia is known for German and Italian influenced cuisine, Poland for world-famous Pierogis which are a cross between a ravioli and an empanada. Liechtenstein and German speaking Switzerland are famous for Rösti and French speaking Switzerland for fondue and Raclettes.
