 Locally-caught seafood has traditionally been important to the cuisines of both  Guernsey  and  Jersey :  mussels  (called  moules  locally),  scallops ,  oysters ,  lobster  and  crabs  — especially  spider crabs  which are considered a particular delicacy.  Ormers  are conserved and fishing is restricted; they were made into Ormer casserole. [1] [2]  A speciality is  conger  eel soup. [3] 
 Channel Island milk  being very rich with a higher fat and protein content than milk from  Holstein Friesian cattle ,  cream  and  butter  have played a large part in insular cooking. [4] 
 The "gastronomic hotspot" [5]  islands of Guernsey, Jersey, and  Sark  have 16 restaurants listed in the Good Food Guide. [5]  Jersey's  Bohemia  restaurant has a  Michelin star  and five  AA rosettes . [5] 
 
 Guernsey [ edit ] 
 Dishes traditional in Guernsey cuisine are the Guernsey  gâche , a rich fruit bread, [1]   gâche mêlaïe , a dense apple cake, [1]  and  Guernsey Bean Jar , a type of  cassoulet  of pork and beans. [1] 
 
 Jersey [ edit ] 
 Bean crock  ( les pais au fou ) can best be described as a sort of Norman  cassoulet . It is a slow-cooked pork and bean stew, most authentically containing a  pig's trotter , water and onions. [6] 
 Cabbage loaf is the traditional Jersey  bread  baked between two  cabbage  leaves, while  Jersey wonders  are a kind of doughnut, not filled with jam. [1] 
 Jersey Royal potatoes  are the local variety of  new potato , and the island is famous for its early crop of small, tasty [ citation needed ]  potatoes from the south-facing côtils (steeply-sloping fields). [1]
