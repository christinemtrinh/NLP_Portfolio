 Cookbook: Cuisine of Argentina 
 
   Argentina portal v t e 
 The  history of Argentine cuisine  is rich and diverse. As a land that has experienced extensive immigration through many years, the country has benefited from numerous food influences. The diverse climate in the region, ranging from subtropical to subpolar, has also helped to considerably broaden the set of ingredients readily available.  European settlers  are largely responsible for Argentina's cuisine, [1]  mostly the  Italians  and  Spaniards . [2]  However, other immigrants such as  Germans , the  French ,  Jews  and the  British , among others, brought their styles of cooking and national recipes with them. [2]  Nevertheless, indigenous gastronomies derived from groups such as the  Quechua ,  Mapuche , and  Guarani  have also played a role; for example,  mate  is consumed throughout the country.
 
 Timeline [ edit ] 
 Several  Indigenous peoples  lived in Argentina long before the European colonizers arrived. Indigenous peoples inhabiting the territory that is now the  Argentine Northwest  were farmers who grew squash, melons, and sweet potatoes. [2]  The Guaraní, who lived in the northeast, were hunter gatherers. Spanish settlers came to Argentina in 1536 [2]  and introduced cattle to the  Pampas , which would have a profound effect on the cuisine of Argentina. [3] 
 Throughout the 19th century, millions of immigrants arrived to Argentina. Most were from Italy and Spain. The Italians introduced pizza, as well as many pasta dishes, including spaghetti and lasagna. [1] [2]  The British started the tradition of  teatime . The French, German, Welsh, Swiss, Jewish, Central and Eastern Europeans [ who? ]  have also influenced the country's cuisine. [1] [2] [3] 
 In 1931, renown  Afro-Argentine  chef  Antonio Gonzaga  published Argentina's first cookbook,  El cocinero práctico argentino  ("The Practical Argentine Cookbook"), credited as the first cookbook in Argentina. The book detailed traditional Argentine cuisine with painstaking effort, chronicling over 300 recipes. [4] [5]  Gonzaga's unabashed focus on traditional Argentine cooking (specifically, that of the  gauchos  and the rural working class) is credited with popularizing  asado  in Buenos Aires and among the Argentine upper classes, who until then disdained Argentine traditions and instead favored French cuisine. In particular, the use of  achuras  such as  chorizo  and  chitterlings , and the steps for preparing the  asado , are credited to Gonzaga's recipes in  El cocinero práctico . [5] [6] 
 Gonzaga's popularity was eventually overshadowed by another famous Argentine cookbook writer,  Doña Petrona , who would go on to revolutionize the field by becoming Argentina's first  television chef .
