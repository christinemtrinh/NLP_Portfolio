 Greenlandic cuisine  is traditionally based on meat from  marine mammals , birds, and fish, and normally contains high levels of protein. Since colonization and the arrival of international trade, the cuisine has been increasingly influenced by  Danish ,  British ,  American  and  Canadian cuisine . [1]  During the summer when the weather is milder, meals are often eaten outdoors. [2] 
 
 
 National dish [ edit ] 
 The  national dish  of  Greenland  is  suaasat , a traditional Greenlandic soup. [3]  It is often made from seal, or from whale, reindeer, or seabirds. The soup often includes onions and potatoes, and is simply seasoned with salt and pepper, or  bay leaf . The soup is often thickened with rice, or by soaking barley in the water overnight so that the starches leach into the water. It is also a traditional  Inuit  food.
 
 Seafood [ edit ] 
   Dried  capelin  ( Mallotus villosus ), or  ammassat 
 Because the majority of Greenland is covered by permanent glaciers, the sea is the source for most food. [4]  Seafood dishes include various fishes (often smoked),  mussels , and  shrimp .  Ammassat  or  capelin  is commonly eaten [2]  and can easily be dried.  Atlantic halibut ,  redfish ,  deepwater redfish ,  Greenland halibut , and  lumpfish  are fished from the west coast, as are  Greenland cod  ( Gadus ogac ) and  shorthorn sculpin  ( Myoxocephalus scorpius ), but these two are eaten only as a last resort. [5]   Arctic char  is fished off the east coast. The  Greenland shark  ( Somniosus microcephalus ) is rarely eaten because it is poisonous but can be edible after a complicated preparation [6]  of either boiling the meat repeatedly or fermenting the meat.
 Global warming  has shifted the migration of  Atlantic cod , allowing for commercial fishing off Greenland's east coast. Drift ice can create problems during fishing season. [7]  There are a couple of large-scale fish and shrimp processing factories in Greenland. [8] 
 Sea mammals provide important staples to Greenlandic diets. A traditional  Inuit  specialty is  mattak , a  Greenlandic  term for the raw hide of  narwhal  or  white whale .  Mattak  can be prepared with blubber, and occasionally dried reindeer meat. When eaten raw,  mattak  is an important source of  vitamin C . [9]  Hunting hooded seals were traditionally an important annual social event as well as subsistence activity, which included men, women, and children. [7]  Also popular is  arfivik , or  bowhead whale , smoked  whale meat  served with onions and potato. Dried cod and whale with  whale blubber  is a popular lunch and snack food. [2]   Bearded  and  ringed seals  are hunted year round, especially by Polar Inuit, while narwhals and white whales are hunted during the summer. [9]  Subsistence whale hunting by indigenous peoples is legal, but some animal rights organizations are concerned about commercial whale hunting in Greenland, with one company, Arctic Green Food freezing and distributing a quarter of Greenland's whale meat. [10] 
 
 Meat [ edit ] 
 Land-based dishes include  caribou ,  lamb , mutton, and  musk-ox , which can be served  tartare . [11]  Sheep farming and cattle ranching were introduced to Greenland by the Norse. [4]  Caribou are hunted in the fall, foxes and hares year round, musk-oxen in the spring, and polar bear are hunted in the spring and fall. [9]  Meats can be boiled, dried, frozen, fermented, or occasionally eaten raw. Caribou livers are consumed raw, immediately after the hunt. [9] 
 
 Birds [ edit ] 
 There are 21 species of birds that legally can be hunted in Greenland, although there are various restrictions (region, period, numbers or method) for several of them. [12]  Spring to fall is the primary season for hunting birds. Among others, the Greenlandic Inuit hunt  dovekie ,  common  and  king eider ,  ptarmigan ,  thick-billed murre , and a variety of  sea gulls . [9]  Additionally,  kittiwake  and ptarmigan are hunted on the east coast. [6]  Sometimes wild eggs are gathered by hunters. [5] 
 
 Plants [ edit ] 
   Crowberries  ( Empetrum nigrum ) 
 Blueberries and  crowberries  ( Empetrum nigrum ), harvested in the autumn, often garnish cakes and other desserts. [2]  Berry compotes accompany meat dishes. [11]   Seaweed  is stored as a reserve food for winter. [5]  During the summer, roseroot ( Sedum rosea ),  fireweed  ( Epilobium ) leaves, and  Greenland lousewort  ( Pedicularis groenlandica ) are gathered. [6]  Green vegetables are scarce but  global climate change  has slightly extended the growing season, so Greenlandic farmers are experimenting with new crops, such as broccoli. [11]  Rice and potatoes are common starches in meals. Onions are commonly found in meals.
 
 Beverages [ edit ] 
   Greenland Brewhouse  brown ale 
 Greenlandic coffee is a popular after-dinner drink. It typically features hot coffee, whiskey,  Kahlúa ,  Grand Marnier , and whipped cream. Served in a bordeaux glass, the coffee is set on fire before drinking. [13] 
 Ice beer, that features 2000-year-old natural Arctic ice harvested from glaciers, was pioneered by the  Greenland Brewhouse  in  Narsaq . [14]  Currently, the  Godthaab Bryghus , in  Nuuk , [15]  and  Icefiord Bryghus , in  Ilulissat , [16]  brew with glacial water. Both crowberries and angelica are brewed into ales at the Icefiord Brewery. [11] 
 Until 1954, alcohol sales were heavily restricted in Greenland, so  homebrewing  is widely popular. [17] 
 
 Markets [ edit ] 
   Produce section of the only grocery store in  Upernavik , a town on northern  West Greenland 
 Animal foods comprised most of the Greenland Inuit diet until around 1980 (and still do today in some regions), but grocery stores now provide coffee, tea, biscuits, potato chips, and other foods. [9]  Depending on location, the diversity of fresh fruit and vegetables varies greatly during the year. In the capital  Nuuk , the diversity is considerably higher and more consistent year-round than in smaller, more isolated places further north. In more isolated regions, supplies depend on ice cover and can typically be delivered by ship during the summer (approximately May through November, but varies depending on exact location) where the diversity is mostly better than in the winter period, where vegetables and fruit only can be delivered by plane.
