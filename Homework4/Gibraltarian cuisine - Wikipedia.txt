 Gibraltarian cuisine  is the result of a long relationship between the people of Spanish  Andalusia  and those of  Great Britain , as well as the many foreigners who have made  Gibraltar  their home over the past three centuries. These influences include those of the culinary traditions of  Malta ,  Genoa , and  Portugal . This marriage of tastes has produced in Gibraltar an eclectic mix of  Mediterranean  and  British cuisines .
 Below are some examples of typical Gibraltarian dishes.
 
 
 Pasta [ edit ] 
 Rosto [ edit ] 
 A popular local pasta dish of  Italian  origin consisting of  penne  in a  tomato sauce  with beef or occasionally pork, mushrooms and carrots (among other vegetables depending on family tradition) and topped with grated " queso bola ". The origin of its name is probably from the English word "roast".
 
 Fideos al horno [ edit ] 
 A baked pasta dish very similar to the Spanish  fideos al horno ,  Maltese   imqarrun  or  Greek   pastitsio  which consists of macaroni,  bolognese sauce , and various other ingredients including egg and bacon that vary according to family tradition. The macaroni is usually topped with a layer of grated cheese or  béchamel  that melts during the baking process and aids in binding. Even though the dish's main ingredient is macaroni, the name  fideos al horno  is actually Spanish for 'baked noodles'.
 
 Bread [ edit ] 
   Gibraltarian  calentita  is very similar to the Italian  farinata . 
 Savoury [ edit ] 
 Calentita [ edit ] 
 This is a baked pancake-like dish, the Italian  farinata , also known in Genoa as  fainâ  and in  Uruguay  and  Argentina  as  fainá , and in the  Nice  region of France as  Socca . It is made with  chickpea flour , water,  olive oil , salt and pepper.
 The word  calentita  is the Spanish informal diminutive of the word  caliente , and means "nice and warm (or hot)". [1] 
 A very similar dish is widely consumed in  Algeria , where it is known as Calentica, Galentita or Karantita. The dish has the same Spanish etymology (the diminutive -ica rather than -ita being typical of eastern Spain). According to local sources, calentita was introduced into Algeria by the Spaniards garrisoned at the port of Santa Cruz during the 16th century.   
 Soon after 1704 well-documented connections were established between the  Barbary Coast  and Gibraltar to victual the garrison, after Gibraltar lost her agricultural land. The  Sephardi Jews  from the Barbary Coast may have reintroduced this dish into Gibraltar, where it was maintained after the recipe was lost or fell out of favor in Spain. Another widely suggested theory is that the origin of calentita is in Genoese migrations to Gibraltar and Iberia which started before the  Anglo-Dutch action of 1704 , although its name makes this unlikely. 
 The  Sephardi Jews  from the Barbary Coast became major food providers for the British in Gibraltar, bringing their customs, languages and food culture. It is widely believed in Gibraltar that name may have come from  street vendors  who would shout " Calentita " to sell their freshly cooked wares, a word which was transferred from the temperature to the foodstuff. [2]  Indeed, the last calentita  street vendor, Paloma, is still remembered locally by older people. [3]  Since the name can be traced to the 16th century during the Spanish presence in Oran, this is a false etymology. [4] 
 
 Panissa [ edit ] 
 A bread-like dish similar to calentita. Sharing its Italian origins, it is a descendant of the  Genoese dish with the same name . Unlike calentita, the ingredients are first simmered in a saucepan for over an hour, stirring constantly, [5]  to form a paste which is then left to set. When the  polenta -like dough is set, it is cut into small strips and fried in olive oil.
 
 Torta de Acelgas [ edit ] 
 A spinach pie very similar to the Greek  spanakopita , which is usually made at Easter Time.
 
 Sweet [ edit ] 
 Bollo de hornasso [ edit ] 
 A sweet and dry bread similar to the  Spanish   hornazo . It is made with  self-raising flour , sugar, eggs, butter or  margarine  and  aniseed .  Bollos de hornasso  are eaten around Easter just as in Spain, but in Gibraltar they are also popular during Christmas. Gibraltarian  hornassos  can normally be distinguished from the original Spanish  hornazo  as they do not tend to be decorated with hard-boiled eggs (however, Gibraltarian families of Spanish descent may still decorate them in this manner). It usually glazed with beaten egg and sometimes decorated with  hundreds and thousands . [6] 
 
 Pan dulce [ edit ] 
 A sweet fruit and nut bread eaten at Christmas time. The term  pan dulce  means "sweet bread" in Spanish, but its origins may lie in Italy with the Genoese  pandolce  or  Portuguese sweet bread . Its main ingredients can include  lard , margarine, sugar, self-raising flour, blanched  almonds ,  raisins ,  sultanas ,  pine nuts ,  candied peel , eggs, aniseed and  anisette  among others. It is sometimes decorated with hundreds and thousands just like the  bollo de hornasso .
 
 Milhojas [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Milhoja 
 Meat [ edit ] 
 Rolitos [ edit ] 
 A thin slice of beef surrounding  breadcrumbs , bacon, eggs, olives, vegetables and herbs. These can be baked, fried or cooked in wine.  Rolitos  is another dish of Maltese origin, similar to  braġjoli . It is also known as  beef olives  in English, even though some families prefer making them with pork or even chicken. The word  rolito  comes from the Spanish word  rollo  meaning 'roll', as the meat is rolled to hold the other ingredients inside.
 
 Confectionery [ edit ] 
   A japonesa sliced in half 
 Japonesa [ edit ] 
 The  japonesa  (English:  Japanese lady ) is a sweet fried  doughnut  filled with a  custard -like cream. Japonesas are usually enjoyed at  teatime  or as a  snack . They are traditionally coated in syrup or granulated sugar. [7]  The name is a reference to Japanese  dorayaki  cakes which are similarly shaped and also have a sweet filling.
