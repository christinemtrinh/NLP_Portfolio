 Chinese cuisine  encompasses the numerous  cuisines  originating from  China , as well as overseas cuisines created by the  Chinese diaspora . Because of the Chinese diaspora and historical power of the country, Chinese cuisine has influenced many other cuisines in  Asia  and beyond, with modifications made to cater to local palates. Chinese food staples such as  rice ,  soy sauce ,  noodles ,  tea ,  chili oil , and  tofu , and utensils such as  chopsticks  and the  wok , can now be found worldwide.
 The preferences for  seasoning  and  cooking techniques  of Chinese provinces depend on differences in  social class ,  religion ,  historical background , and  ethnic groups . Geographic features including mountains, rivers, forests, and deserts also have a strong effect on the local available ingredients, considering that the climate of China varies from  tropical  in the south to  subarctic  in the northeast.  Imperial royal and noble preference  also plays a role in the change of Chinese cuisine. Because of imperial expansion and trading, ingredients and cooking techniques from other cultures have been integrated into Chinese cuisines over time.
 There are numerous regional, religious, and ethnic styles of Chinese cuisine found within China and abroad. Chinese cuisine is highly diverse and most frequently categorised into provincial divisions, although these province-level classifications consist of many more styles within themselves. The most praised  Four Great Traditions  in Chinese cuisine are  Chuan ,  Lu ,  Yue , and  Huaiyang , representing cuisines of West, North, South, and East China, respectively. [1]  The modern  Eight Cuisines of China  are  Anhui  ( 徽菜 ;  Huīcài ),  Guangdong  ( 粤菜 ;  Yuècài ),  Fujian  ( 闽菜 ;  Mǐncài ),  Hunan  ( 湘菜 ;  Xiāngcài ),  Jiangsu  ( 苏菜 ;  Sūcài ),  Shandong  ( 鲁菜 ;  Lǔcài ),  Sichuan  ( 川菜 ;  Chuāncài ), and  Zhejiang  ( 浙菜 ;  Zhècài ) cuisines. [2] 
 
   A  Quanjude  cook is slicing  Peking roast duck . Peking duck is eaten by rolling pieces of duck with scallion, cucumber and  sweet bean sauce  using steamed pancakes. [3] 
 Color, scent and taste are the three traditional aspects used to describe Chinese food, [4]  as well as the meaning, appearance, and nutrition of the food. Cooking should be appraised with respect to the ingredients used, knife work, cooking time, and seasoning.
 
 
 History [ edit ] 
 Main article:  History of Chinese cuisine 
 See also:  List of sources of Chinese culinary history 
 Pre-Tang dynasty [ edit ] 
   Dàzhǔ gānsī  is a typical soup dish of  Huaiyang cuisine . It is made of finely sliced dried tofu, chicken, ham and bamboo shoot, and the ingredients need to be braised with shrimp in chicken soup. It was highly praised by the  Qianlong emperor . [5] 
   Làzǐ Jī , stir-fried chicken with chili and  Sichuan pepper  in Sichuan style 
   Steamed whole  perch  with roe inside. Sliced ginger and spring onion is usually spread on top. 
 Chinese society greatly valued  gastronomy , and developed an extensive study of the subject based on its  traditional medical beliefs .  Chinese culture initially centered around the  North China Plain . The first domesticated crops seem to have been the  foxtail  and  broomcorn  varieties of  millet , while  rice  was cultivated in the south. By 2000 BC, wheat had arrived from western Asia. These grains were typically served as warm  noodle  soups instead of baked into bread as in Europe. Nobles hunted various wild game and consumed  mutton , pork and  dog  as these animals were domesticated. Grain was stored against famine and flood and meat was preserved with salt, vinegar, curing, and fermenting. The flavor of the meat was enhanced by cooking it in animal fats though this practice was mostly restricted to the wealthy. [6] 
 By the time of  Confucius  in the  late Zhou , gastronomy had become a high art. Confucius discussed the principles of dining: "The rice would never be too white, the meat would never be too finely cut... When it was not cooked right, man would not eat. When it was cooked bad, man would not eat. When the meat was not cut properly, man would not eat. When the food was not prepared with the right sauce, man would not eat. Although there are plenty of meats, they should not be cooked more than staple food. There is no limit for alcohol, before a man gets drunk." [7]  The  Lüshi chunqiu  notes: "Only if one is chosen as the Son of Heaven will the tastiest delicacies be prepared [for him]." [8] 
 The  Zhaohun  (4-3rd c. BC) gives some examples: turtle ragout, honey cakes and beer (chilled with ice).
 During  Shi Huangdi 's  Qin dynasty , the empire expanded into the south. By the time of the  Han dynasty , the different regions and cuisines of China's people were linked by major  canals  and leading to greater complexity in the different regional cuisines. Not only is food seen as giving " qi ", energy, but the food is also about maintaining yin and yang. [9]  The philosophy behind it was rooted in the  I Ching  and  Chinese traditional medicine : food was judged for color, aroma, taste, and texture and a good meal was expected to balance the  Four Natures  (' hot ', warm, cool, and ' cold ') and the  Five Tastes  (pungent, sweet, sour, bitter, and salty).  
Salt was used as a preservative  from early times, but in cooking was added in the form of soy sauce, and not at the table. [10] 
 By the Later Han period (2nd century), writers [ who? ]  frequently complained of lazy aristocrats who did nothing but sit around all day eating  smoked  meats and roasts.
 During the  Han dynasty , the Chinese developed methods of food preservation for military rations during campaigns such as drying meat into  jerky  and cooking, roasting, and drying grain. [11] 
Chinese legends claim that the roasted, flat bread  shaobing  was brought back from the  Xiyu  (the Western Regions, a name for  Central Asia ) by the Han dynasty General  Ban Chao , and that it was originally known as hubing ( 胡餅 , lit. "barbarian bread"). The shaobing is believed to be descended from the hubing. [12]   Shaobing  is believed to be related to the Persian  nan  and Central Asian  nan , as well as the Middle Eastern  pita . [13] [14] [15] [16]  Foreign westerners made and sold sesame cakes in China during the Tang dynasty. [17] 
 During the  Southern and Northern dynasties  non-Han people like the  Xianbei  of  Northern Wei  introduced their cuisine to northern China, and these influences continued up to the  Tang dynasty , popularizing meat like mutton and dairy products like goat milk, yogurts, and  Kumis  among even Han people. It was during the Song dynasty that  Han Chinese  developed an aversion to dairy products and abandoned the dairy foods introduced earlier. [18] 
 The Han Chinese rebel Wang Su who received asylum in the Xianbei Northern Wei after fleeing from Southern Qi, at first could not stand eating dairy products like goat's milk and meat like mutton and had to consume tea and fish instead, but after a few years he was able to eat yogurt and lamb, and the Xianbei Emperor asked him which of the foods of China (Zhongguo) he preferred, fish vs mutton and tea vs yogurt. [19] [20] [21] [22] 
 
 Post-Tang dynasty [ edit ] 
 The great migration of Chinese people south during the invasions preceding and during the  Song dynasty  increased the relative importance of  southern Chinese  staples such as rice and  congee .  Su Dongpo  has improved the red braised pork as  Dongpo pork . [23]  The dietary and culinary habits also changed greatly during this period, with many ingredients such as  soy sauce  and Central Asian influenced foods becoming widespread and the creation of important cookbooks such as the  Shanjia Qinggong  ( Chinese :  山家清供 ;  pinyin :  shanjia qinggong ) and the  Wushi Zhongkuilu  ( Chinese :  吳氏中饋錄 ;  pinyin :  wushi zhoungkuilu ) showing the respective esoteric foods and common household cuisine of the time. [24] 
 The  Yuan  and  Qing  dynasties introduced  Mongolian  and  Manchu cuisine , warm northern dishes that popularized  hot pot  cooking. During the  Yuan dynasty  many  Muslim communities  emerged in China, who practiced a porkless cuisine now preserved by  Hui restaurants  throughout the country. [ citation needed ]   Yunnan cuisine  is unique in China for its cheeses like  Rubing  and  Rushan cheese  made by the  Bai people , and its yogurt, the yogurt may have been due to a combination of Mongolian influence during the Yuan dynasty, the Central Asian settlement in Yunnan, and the proximity and influence of India and Tibet on Yunnan. [25] 
 As part of the last leg of the  Columbian Exchange , Spanish and Portuguese traders began introducing foods from the New World to China through the port cities of  Canton  and  Macau . Mexican  chili peppers  became essential ingredients in  Sichuan cuisine  and calorically dense potatoes and corn became staple foods across the northern plains.
 During the Qing dynasty, Chinese gastronomes such as  Yuan Mei  focused upon the primary goal of extracting the maximum flavour of each ingredient. As noted in his culinary work the  Suiyuan shidan , however, the fashions of cuisine at the time were quite varied and in some cases were flamboyantly ostentatious, [26]  especially when the display served also a formal ceremonial purpose, as in the case of the  Manchu Han Imperial Feast . [27] 
 As the pace of life increases in modern China, fast food like  fried noodles ,  fried rice  and  gaifan  (dish over rice) become more and more popular.
 
 Regional cuisines [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Chinese regional cuisine 
   Map showing major regional cuisines of China 
   " Lion's head  with  crab meat " ( 蟹粉獅子頭 ) is a traditional eastern Chinese meatball soup. 
 There are a variety of styles of cooking in China, but most Chinese chefs classified eight regional cuisines according to their distinct tastes and local characteristics. A number of different styles contribute to Chinese cuisine but perhaps the best known and most influential are  Cantonese cuisine ,  Shandong cuisine ,  Jiangsu cuisine  (specifically  Huaiyang cuisine ) and  Sichuan cuisine . [28] [29]  These styles are distinctive from one another due to factors such as availability of resources, climate,  geography ,  history , cooking techniques and lifestyle. [30]  One style may favour the use of  garlic  and  shallots  over chili and spices, while another may favour preparing  seafood  over other meats and  fowl .  Jiangsu cuisine  favours cooking techniques such as  braising  and  stewing , while  Sichuan cuisine  employs  baking .  Zhejiang cuisine  focuses more on serving fresh food and shares some traits in common with Japanese food.  Fujian cuisine  is famous for its delicious seafood and soups and the use of spices.  Hunan cuisine  is famous for its hot and sour taste.  Anhui cuisine  incorporates wild food for an unusual taste and is wilder than Fujian cuisine. [31] 
 Based on the raw materials and ingredients used, the method of preparation and cultural differences, a variety of foods with different flavors and textures are prepared in different regions of the country. Many traditional regional cuisines rely on basic methods of  preservation  such as  drying ,  salting ,  pickling  and  fermentation . [32] 
 In addition, the "rice theory" attempts to describe cultural differences between north and south China; in the north, noodles are more consumed due to wheat being widely grown whereas in the south, rice is more preferred as it has historically been more cultivated there. [33] 
 
 Staple foods [ edit ] 
 Staple foods in China: rice, breads and various kinds of noodles 
 Chinese ancestors successfully planted  millet ,  rice , and other grains about 8,000 to 9,000 years ago. [34]  As for  wheat , another staple, it took another three or four thousand years. For the first time, grains provided people with a steady supply of food. Because of the lack of various foods, Chinese people had to adapt to new eating habits. The meat was scarce at that time, that's why people cooked with small amounts of meat and rice or noodles. [35] 
 
 Rice [ edit ] 
 Rice  is a primary  staple food  for people from rice farming areas in southern China. [36]   Steamed rice , usually  white rice , is the most commonly eaten form. People in South China also like to use rice to make congee as breakfast. [37]  Rice is also used to produce  beer ,  baijiu  and  vinegar .    Glutinous rice  ("sticky rice") is a variety of rice used in special dishes such as lotus leaf rice and glutinous rice balls.
 
 Wheat [ edit ] 
 In wheat-farming areas in  Northern China , people largely rely on  flour -based food, such as  noodles ,  bing  (bread),  jiaozi  (a kind of Chinese  dumplings ), and  mantou  (a type of steamed buns). [28]  Wheat likely "appeared in the lower Yellow River around 2600 Before Common Era (BCE), followed by Gansu and Xinjiang around 1900 BCE and finally occurred in the middle Yellow River and Tibet regions by 1600 BCE". [38] 
 
 Noodles [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Chinese noodles 
 Chinese noodles  come dry or fresh in a variety of sizes, shapes and textures and are often served in soups or fried as toppings. Some varieties, such as Shou Mian (寿面, literally noodles of longevity), is an avatar of long life and good health according to Chinese traditions. [28]  Noodles can be served hot or cold with different toppings, with broth, and occasionally dry (as is the case with mi-fen).  Noodles are commonly made with rice flour or wheat flour, but other flours such as  soybean  are also used in minor groups. The names given to the noodle is unique in their own way, such as the method used to make the noodle as in hand-pulled noodle. [39] 
 
 Soybean products [ edit ] 
   Several kinds of soybean products are sold in a farmer's market in  Haikou , China. 
   Stir-fried  razor shell  with  douchi  (fermented black soybeans) in  Jiaodong  style 
 Tofu  is made of  soybeans  and is another popular food product that supplies protein. The production process of tofu varies from region to region, resulting in different kinds of tofu with a wide range of texture and taste. [32]  Other products such as  soy milk ,  soy paste ,  soy oil , and fermented  soy sauce  are also important in Chinese cooking.
 There are many kinds of soybean products, including  tofu skin , smoked tofu, dried tofu, and fried tofu.
 Stinky tofu  is fermented tofu. Like  blue cheese  or  durian , it has a very distinct, potent and strong smell, and is an acquired taste. Hard stinky tofu is often deep-fried and paired with soy sauce or salty spice. Soft stinky tofu is usually used as a spread on steamed buns.
 Doufuru  is another type of fermented tofu that has a salty taste. Doufuru can be pickled together with soy beans,  red yeast rice  or chili to create different color and flavor. This is more of a pickled type of tofu and is not as strongly scented as stinky tofu.  Doufuru has the consistency of slightly soft blue cheese, and a taste similar to Japanese  miso paste , but less salty. Doufuru can be used as a spread on steamed buns, or paired with  rice congee .
 Sufu  is one other type of fermented tofu that goes through ageing process. The color (red, white, green) and flavor profile can determine the type of sufu it is. This kind of tofu is usually eaten alongside breakfast rice. [40] 
 Soybean milk is soybean-based milk. It is a morning beverage, and it has many benefits to human health. [41] 
 
 Vegetables [ edit ] 
 Apart from vegetables that can be commonly seen, some unique  vegetables  used in Chinese cuisine include  baby corn ,  bok choy ,  snow peas ,  Chinese   eggplant ,  Chinese broccoli , and  straw mushrooms .  Other vegetables including  bean sprouts , pea vine tips,  watercress ,  lotus roots , chestnuts, water chestnuts, and  bamboo shoots  are also used in different cuisines of China.
 Because of different climate and soil conditions, cultivars of green beans, peas, and mushrooms can be found in rich variety.
 A variety of dried or pickled vegetables are also processed, especially in drier or colder regions where fresh vegetables were hard to get out of season.
 
 Herbs and seasonings [ edit ] 
 Ingredients of  wu xiang fen  (five-spice powder) are Sichuan peppercorn, cloves, cinnamon, fennel seeds, and star anise. Sanbeiji  (three-cup chicken) traditionally is prepared with  lard ,  jiuniang  (rice wine pudding) and  soy sauce . 
 Seasonings  such as fresh  ginger  root,  garlic ,  scallion ,  cilantro  and  sesame  are widely used in many regional cuisines.  Sichuan peppercorns ,  star anise ,  cinnamon ,  fennel ,  cloves  and  white peppers  and  smart weed  are also used in different regions. [42] [43] 
 To add extra flavor to the dishes, many Chinese cuisines also contain dried Chinese mushrooms, dried baby shrimp, dried tangerine peel, [44]  and dried Sichuan chillies.
 When it comes to  sauces , China is home to soy sauce, which is made from fermented soybeans and wheat. A number of sauces are also based on fermented soybeans, including  hoisin sauce , ground bean sauce and yellow bean sauce. There are also different sauces preferred by regional cuisines,  oyster sauce ,  fish sauce  and furu (fermented tofu) are also widely used. Vinegar also has a variety with different flavors: clear rice vinegar,  Chinkiang black rice vinegar , Shanxi vinegar, Henghe vinegar etc.
 
 Desserts and snacks [ edit ] 
 Main articles:  Chinese desserts  and  Chinese pastries 
 See also:  List of Chinese desserts 
 Different  gāo diǎn  (traditional Chinese pastry) with different stuffing, including  lotus seed , rose, and mixture of pea and  jackbean Egg custard tart  is a type of  xī diǎn  (Western pastry) originally from Portugal and gain its popularity through  Hong Kong . 
 Generally, seasonal fruits serve as the most common form of dessert consumed after dinner. [45] 
 Dim sum  (点心), originally means a small portion of food, can refer to dessert, or pastries. Later to avoid disambiguation, tian dian (甜点) and gao dian (糕点) are used to describe desserts and pastries.
 Traditionally, Chinese desserts are sweet foods and dishes that are served with tea, usually during the meal, [46] [47]  or at the end of meals in Chinese cuisine. [48] 
 Besides being served as dim sum along with tea, pastries are used for celebration of traditional festivals. [49]  The most famous one is  moon cake , used to celebrate the  Mid-Autumn Festival .
 A wide variety of  Chinese desserts  are available, mainly including steamed and boiled sweet snacks.  Bing  is an umbrella term for all breads in Chinese, also including pastries and sweets. These are baked wheat-flour-based confections, with different stuffings including  red bean paste ,  jujube , and a variety of others. Su (酥) is another kind of pastry made with more amount of oil, making the confection more friable. Chinese candies and sweets, called  táng  (糖) [50]  are usually made with  cane sugar , malt sugar, honey, nuts, and fruit.  Gao or Guo  are rice-based snacks that are typically steamed [50]  and may be made from glutinous or normal rice.
 Another cold dessert is called  baobing , which is  shaved ice  with sweet syrup. [50]  Chinese jellies are known collectively in the language as  ices . Many jelly desserts are traditionally set with agar and are flavoured with fruits, known as guodong (果冻), [51]  though  gelatine  based jellies are also common in contemporary desserts.
 Chinese dessert soups are typically sweet and served hot. [50] 
 European pastries are also seen in China, like  mille-feuille ,  crème brûlée , and  cheesecake , but they are generally not as popular because the Chinese preference of dessert is mildly sweet and less oily. [ citation needed ] 
 
   Bāozi  are steamed buns containing savoury or sweet combinations of meat, vegetables, and mushrooms, traditionally associated with breakfast. 
 Many types of street foods, which vary from region to region, can be eaten as snacks or light dinner.  Prawn crackers  are an often-consumed snack in Southeast China. [ citation needed ] 
 
 Dairy products [ edit ] 
 Chinese in earlier dynasties evidently drank milk and ate dairy products, although not necessarily from cows, but perhaps  kumis  (fermented mare's milk) or goat's milk.
 Historically, many Chinese chefs tried not to use milk, because of the high rate of  lactose intolerance among the Chinese population . However, today, dairy products are increasingly used in Chinese cuisine, such as the " double skin milk " dessert in Guangdong Province, the Rubing (milk cake) cheese in  Yunnan , and  yoghurt  in Qinghai and Xinjiang. China has a wide variety of dairy desserts that are very popular. [50] 
 
 Cold dishes [ edit ] 
 See also:  Chinese pickles 
 Stewed pig's ear as  lou mei  is usually served cold. Pídàn dòufǔ  ( century egg  and  tofu ) 
 Cold dishes are usually served before the main meal. Besides salad and pickles as appetizers, they can range from jelly, beancurd, noodle salad, cooked meat and sausages, to jellyfish or cold soups.
 Chinese sausages  vary from region to region. The most common sausage is made of pork and pork fat. The flavor is generally salty-sweet in Southern China. In other parts of China, sausages are salted to be preserved. Chinese sausage is prepared in many different ways, including oven-roasting, stir-frying, and  steaming . [52] 
 
 Soups [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Chinese soup 
   Dōngguā xiārén fěnsī tāng  (winter melon, shrimp and cellophane noodle soup) 
 See also:  List of Chinese soups 
 In some part of South China, soups are served between the cold dishes and the main dishes. In other parts of China, soups are served between the main dish and staple foods, before desserts or fruit salad. There are many traditional Chinese soups, such as  wonton  soup, herbal chicken soup,  hot and sour soup ,  winter melon soup , [53]  and so on.
 
 Drinks [ edit ] 
 Tea plays an important role in Chinese dining culture. In China, there are two main types of tea, one is made from dried tea leaves, the other one is made by extracts from tea leaves. [54]   Baijiu  and  huangjiu  as strong alcoholic beverages are preferred by many people as well. Wine is not so popular as other drinks in China that are consumed whilst dining, although they are usually available in the menu.
 
 Tea [ edit ] 
   Longjing tea , also known as Dragon Well tea, is a variety of roasted green tea from  Hangzhou ,  Zhejiang  Province, China, where it is produced mostly by hand and has been renowned for its high quality, earning the  China Famous Tea  title. 
 Main article:  Chinese tea 
 As well as with dim sum, many Chinese drink their tea with snacks such as nuts, plums, dried fruit (in particular  jujube ), small sweets, melon seeds, and  waxberry . [28]  China was the earliest country to cultivate and drink tea, which is enjoyed by people from all social classes. [55]  Tea processing began after the  Qin  and  Han  dynasties. [55] 
 The different types of Chinese tea include black, white, green, yellow, oolong, and dark tea. Chinese tea is often classified into several different categories according to the species of plant from which it is sourced, the region in which it is grown, and the method of production used. Some of these types are  green tea ,  oolong tea , black tea, scented tea,  white tea , and  compressed tea . There are four major  tea plantation  regions:  Jiangbei ,  Jiangnan ,  Huanan  and the southwestern region. [55]  Well known types of green tea include  Longjing ,  Huangshan ,  Mao Feng ,  Bilochun ,  Putuofeng Cha , and  Liu'an Guapian . [56]  China is the world's largest exporter of green tea. [56] 
 One of the most ubiquitous accessories in modern China, after a wallet or purse and an umbrella, is a double-walled insulated glass thermos with tea leaves in the top behind a strainer.
 
 Alcoholic beverages [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Chinese alcoholic beverages 
 The importance of  baijiu  ( lit.  "white liquor") in China (99.5% of its alcoholic market) makes it the most-consumed alcoholic spirit in the world. [57]  It dates back to the introduction of distilling during the  Song dynasty ; [28]  can be made from wheat, corn, or rice; and is usually around 120 proof (60% ABV). The most ubiquitous brand is the cheap  Er guo tou , but  Mao Tai  is the premium  baijiu . Other popular brands include Kang, Lu Zhou Te Qu, and Wu Liang Ye. [28] 
 Huangjiu  ( lit.  "yellow liquor") is not distilled and is a strong  rice wine  (10–15% ABV). [28]  Popular brands include  Shaoxing Lao Jiu ,  Shaoxing Hua Diao , and  Te Jia Fan . [28] 
 While fermented grain beverages have been brewed in China for over 9,000 years, it has been long overshadowed by stronger alcohol like  Baijiu  and  Huangjiu . [58] 
 
 Herbal drinks [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Chinese herb tea 
 Chinese herb tea, also known as  medicinal herbal tea , is a kind of tea made from Chinese medicinal  herbs . [59] 
 
 Other beverages [ edit ] 
 Soy milk,  almond milk , walnut milk and coconut milk are also drunk during the meal in different regions. In some parts of China,  hawthorn  and  jujube  juice are preferred.  A small shot of fruit vinegar is served as an appetizer in  Shanxi .
 
 Outside China [ edit ] 
   Zhájiàng Miàn  (noodles with bean paste) is a traditional northern Chinese dish. It has spread to South Korea where it is known as  Jajangmyeon . 
 Where there are historical immigrant Chinese populations, the style of food has evolved and been adapted to local tastes and ingredients, and modified by the local cuisine, to greater or lesser extents. This has resulted in a deep Chinese influence on other national cuisines such as  Cambodian cuisine ,  Filipino cuisine ,  Singaporean cuisine ,  Thai cuisine  and  Vietnamese cuisine . There are also a large number of forms of  fusion cuisine , often popular in the country in question. Some, such as  ramen  ( Japanese Chinese cuisine ) have become popular internationally.
 Deep-fried meat combined with  sweet and sour  sauce as a cooking style receives an enormous preference outside of China. Therefore, many similar international Chinese cuisines are invented based on sweet and sour sauce, including Sweet and sour chicken (Europe and North America), Manchurian chicken (India) or  tangsuyuk  (South Korea). The  Hawaiian pizza  was inspired by Chinese sweet and sour flavors.
 Apart from the host country, the dishes developed in overseas Chinese cuisines are heavily dependent on the cuisines derived from the origin of the Chinese immigrants. In  Korean Chinese cuisine , the dishes derive primarily from  Shandong cuisine  while  Filipino Chinese cuisine  is strongly influenced by  Fujian cuisine .  American Chinese cuisine  has distinctive dishes (such as  chop suey ) originally based on Cantonese cuisine, which are more popular among non-Chinese Americans than with  Chinese Americans  themselves. [60] [61] 
 According to the report released by China's largest on-demand service platform in 2018, there are over 600,000 Chinese restaurants overseas. The report also pointed out that  hotpot  is the most popular food in the foreign market.  Sichuan cuisine  and some Chinese snacks and fast food followed in second and third place, respectively.

 Dining etiquette [ edit ] 
   Silverware from the Song dynasty (10th – 13th centuries): Chopsticks, bowl and spoon 
 Main article:  Customs and etiquette in Chinese dining 
 Youths should not begin eating before their elders do. When eating from a bowl, one should not hold it with its bottom part, because it resembles the act of begging.  Chopsticks  are the main eating utensils for Chinese food, which can be used to cut and pick up food. [63]  When someone is taking a break from eating at the table, they should not put the chopstick into the rice vertically, because it resembles the Chinese traditional funeral tribute, which involves putting chopsticks inside a bowl of rice vertically. It is considered inappropriate to use knives on the dining table. [64]  Chopsticks should not be waved around in the air or played with. Food should first be taken from the plate in front. It is considered impolite to stare at a plate. Watching TV, using mobile phones or doing other activities while eating is considered in poor taste. If an older person puts food in a younger person's bowl, the younger person should thank them. [65] 
 
 Relation to Chinese philosophy and religion [ edit ] 
   Mooncake , eaten during the Mid-Autumn Festival 
 Food plays various roles in social and cultural life. In  Chinese folk religion ,  ancestor veneration  is conducted by offering food to ancestors and Chinese festivals involve the consumption and preparation of specific foods which have symbolic meanings attached to them. Specific religions in China have their own cuisines such as the  Taoist diet ,  Buddhist cuisine  and  Chinese Islamic Cuisine . 
 The  Kaifeng Jews  in  Henan  province once had their own Chinese Jewish cuisine but the community has largely died out in the modern era and not much is known about the specifics of their cuisine but they did influence foods eaten in their region and some of their dishes remain. [66]  Chinese dishes with purported Kaifeng Jewish roots include Kaifeng xiao long bao, Mayuxing bucket-shaped chicken, Chrysanthemum hot pot, and Four Treasures. [67] 
 Food also plays a role in daily life. The formality of the meal setting can signify what kind of relationship people have with one another, and the type of food can indicate ones' social status and their country of origin. [35]  In a formal setting, up to sixteen of any combination of hot and cold dishes would be served to respect the guests. On the other hand, in a casual setting, people would eat inexpensive meals such as at food stalls or homemade food. The typical disparity in food in the Chinese society between the wealthy and everyone below that group lies in the rarity and cost of the food or ingredient, such as shark fins and bear paws. [35]  Depending on whether one goes for rice or anything that is made of wheat flour such as noodle or bread as their main source of food, people within similar culture or of different background can assume other's country of origin from the south or north of China. Different foods have different symbolic meanings.  Mooncakes  and  dumplings  are symbolic of the  Mid-autumn festival  and the Spring Festival, respectively. [35]   Pear  symbolizes bad luck due to its similarity in pronunciation of 'away' in the native language and noodle means living a long life for its length. [35] [68] 
 In Chinese philosophy, food frequently conveys a message. A Chinese philosophy  I Ching  says, “Gentlemen use eating as a way to attain happiness. They should be aware of what they say, and refrain from eating too much." [69] 
 
   Jiaozi , eaten during the Spring Festival 
 Chinese culture has guidelines in how and when food are eaten. Chinese people typically eat three meals a day. Breakfast is served around 6–9am, lunch is served around 12–2pm, and dinner is served around 6–9pm. [68]  Within the Chinese culture, families do follow different traditions. In some families, the elderly members and youngsters get their meal first, then the mother and father, and then the children and teenagers. [68]  Other families have the male and female eat separately at different seating area. [35]  Whatever tradition the family decide to follow, it is intended to show respect to members of the family.
 
 Stereotypes [ edit ] 
 Food from Chinese restaurants in the United States is often the subject of negative stereotypes and racial insensitivity, such as being claimed to be unsafe due to contamination of Chinese-imported food or the use of  monosodium glutamate  (MSG). The latter of which is believed to cause  Chinese restaurant syndrome , despite the alleged risks of monosodium glutamate being scientifically discredited. Food scares in China often receive heightened attention and racial stereotyping in Western media. [70] [71] 
 Chinese people themselves are also stereotyped to eat animals such as bats and dogs, which are unusual to Western cuisines. This notion was  amplified during the   COVID-19 pandemic ; for example, U.S. Senator  John Cornyn  characterized China in March 2020 as "a culture where people eat bats and snakes and dogs and things like that". [72] [73]
