 Somalia portal v t e 
   Location of Somalia before 1991 
 Somali cuisine  is the traditional cuisine of  Somalis  from the  Horn of Africa . Somali cuisine does have moderate foreign influence from different countries mainly due to trade but traditionally also varies from region to region due to the expansive landmass Somalis inhabit with traditions varying in different regions which makes it a  fusion  of differing  Somali  culinary traditions. [1]  It is the product of  Somalia 's  tradition of trade and commerce . Some notable Somali delicacies include  Kimis / Sabaayad ,  Canjeero / Lahoh ,  Xalwo  ( Halwa ),  Sambuusa  ( Samosa ),  Bariis Iskukaris , and  Muqmad / Odkac .
 Pork consumption is forbidden to Muslims in Somalia, in accordance with  Sharia , the Islamic law. Among the  Somali people , most  clans  have a taboo against the consumption of fish, and do not intermarry with the few occupational clans that do eat it.
 
 
 Breakfast [ edit ] 
 Breakfast ( Quraac ) is an important meal for Somalis, who often start the day with Somali style  tea  ( shaah / shaax ) or  coffee  ( qaxwa ).  The tea, brewed from  black tea  leaves, can be served regularly as-is ( shaah rinji  or  shaah bigays ); but it can be also flavoured with spices such as ginger, cardamom and cinnamon (though black pepper is not used unlike other  spiced teas ) while milk is added after the brewing instead of during it; this is known as  shaah cadeys . [2] 
 The main dish is typically a  pancake -like bread called a  canjeero  or  lahoh  originating in  Somalia [3] [4]  and is eaten in different ways. It is often eaten along with  Honey  and  Ghee  / Olive oil / Sesame oil  and washed down with a cup of  Tea . It may also be broken into small pieces with Somali  Ghee  ( Subag ) and sugar. For children, it is mixed with tea and  Sesame oil / Olive oil  ( Macsaro ) until mushy. Typically there may be a side dish of liver (usually  beef ),  goat meat  ( hilib ari ), diced beef cooked in a bed of soup ( suqaar ), or  odkac , which consists of small dried pieces of beef, goat or camel meat, boiled in ghee.  Different from Ethiopian  Injera , Somali  Canjeero  is smaller, thinner and sweeter. It might also be eaten with a stew ( Maraq ) or soup. [5] 
 
 Sabaayad  or  Kimis / Cesh  is another type of  flatbread  which is similar to the  Desi   Paratha . During lunch,  Kimis / Sabaayad  is sometimes consumed with Somali  Curry , Soup, or Stew. 
 Muufo [6]  is another type of Somali Flatbread popular within South Somalia and is usually eaten with Stews and Soup but is also sometimes eaten at breakfast with  Honey / Sugar ,  Sesame oil ,  Subag  and  Black tea 
 Mushaari  or  Boorash  ( porridge ), with Butter, Nuts and Sugar is eaten across Somalia. 
 Nationally, a sweeter and greasy version of  Canjeero , similar to a crepe known as  Malawax  or  Malawah  is a staple of most home-cooked meals and is usually eaten for breakfast with  Tea , similarly to how  Canjeero  is eaten. 
 Lunch [ edit ] 
   Baasto  (pasta) made of  spaghetti  and  digaag  (chicken) take-out from a Somali restaurant 
 Lunch ( qado ) is often an elaborated main dish of  laxoox ,  pasta  ( baasto ) or  rice  ( Bariis iskukaris ) spiced with  cumin  ( kamuun ),  cardamom  ( heyl ),  cloves  ( dhegayare ), and  sage  ( Salvia somalensis ). The diffused use of pasta ( baasto ), such as  spaghetti , [7]  comes from the  Italians . It is frequently presented with a heavier stew than the Italian pasta sauce. As with the rice, it is often served with a banana.
 Spaghetti can also be served with rice, forming a novelty dish referred to as "Federation". The dish is usually served with equal (whole) portions of rice and spaghetti, split on either side of a large oval plate. It is then layered with assorted stewed meats and vegetables, served with salad and an optional banana. It has been suggested that the name of the dish is derived from the union of two dishes in Somalia and also from the size and quantity of the food. You will not find this dish served in the average Somali household, since it is uncommon to cook both rice and pasta in one meal. It is instead more common to order the dish from traditional Somali restaurants, where both rice and spaghetti are always readily available. Hence, its novelty status.
 In  Somalia  many people eat some Arab cuisines such as  Ful  (fava beans) with  Kimis  or  Canjeero , also with  Hummus . Other dishes include  Falafel  with Hummus or are eaten with  Pita bread , salad and hummus (like a sandwich).
 Another popular dish in the south is  iskukaris , a  Hot pot  ( maraq ) of rice, vegetables and meat, a national staple. Beyond the many styles of hot pot, rice is usually served with a banana on the side. In Mogadishu, steak ( Busteeki ) and fish ( Kalluun / Mallaay ) are widely eaten.
 Southern Somalis commonly consume a stiff  cornmeal  referred to as  Soor  which is usually eaten alongside Stews or Soup.
 Another commonly eaten  Cornmeal  is eaten called  Asida . It is mashed with fresh milk, butter and sugar, or presented with a hole in the middle filled with  maraq , or olive oil.
 
   Bariis iskukaris , a Somali  camel meat  and rice dish 
 A variation of flat bread is  sabaayad / kimis / cesh . Like the rice, is served with  maraq  and meat on the side. The  sabaayad  of Somalia is often somewhat sweet, and is cooked in a little oil.
 Popular drinks at lunch are  balbeelmo  ( grapefruit ),  raqey  ( tamarind ) and  isbarmuunto  ( lemonade ). In Mogadishu,  fiimto  ( Vimto ) and  laas  ( lassi ) are also common. In the northwest, the preferred drinks are  cambe ( mango ) ( guava ) and   tufaax  ( apple ).
 Bariis iskukaris  is also popular, a rice dish cooked and fried with onions, meat, then mixed with a Somali spice mixture called  xawaash  which contains cumin, coriander, turmeric, cardamon, black pepper, cloves, and nutmeg. It is traditionally served at Somali weddings.
 
 Dinner [ edit ] 
   A bag of traditional Somali  cambuulo  ( azuki beans ) 
 Dinner ( casho ) in Somalia is served as late as 9 pm. During  Ramadan , dinnertime often follows  Tarawih  prayers, sometimes as late as 11 pm.  Cambuulo , a common dinner dish, is made from well-cooked  azuki beans  mixed with butter and sugar. The beans, which on their own are referred to as  digir , can take up to five hours to finish cooking when left on the stove at a low temperature.  Qamadi  ( wheat ) is also used; cracked or uncracked, it is cooked and served just like the azuki beans.
 Rooti iyo xalwo , slices of bread served with a  gelatinous  confection, is another dinner dish.  Muufo , a variation of  cornbread , is a dish made of maize and is baked in a  tinaar  ( clay oven ). It is eaten by cutting it into small pieces, topped with  sesame oil  ( macsaro ) and sugar, then mashed together with  black tea .
 Before sleeping, a glass of milk spiced with  cardamom  is often consumed.
 
 
 Snacks [ edit ] 
   Somali  sambuusas  ( samosas ) being prepared 
 Sambusa, the Somali variation of the Desi samosa, is a triangular snack that is commonly eaten throughout Somalia during the afur (iftar). Kabaab is a snack eaten in western Somalia. There are several varieties of this dish. For instance, it may be served on sticks or skewers with vegetables. Kebabs are also eaten in Mogadishu. Another common variety consists of minced meat mixed with egg and flour then fried is popular in south Somalia. It resembles kofta kebab. Other snacks eaten include chicken and vegetable filled rolls and bajiyo, which is made from  black-eyed peas  or azuki beans and is usually served with spicy sauce. These along with samosas are very popular not only during Ramadan but also in special occasions such as weddings and family gatherings. Homemade chips are made with fresh potato and some black pepper. Fruits, such as mango (cambo), guava (seytuun), banana (moos), and orange (liinbanbeelmo) are eaten throughout the day.
 
 Sweets [ edit ] 
   Gashaato , a coconut-based confection 
   Xalwo  ( halwo ) or  halva  is a staple of Somali cuisine. 
 Xalwo  or  halwo  (not comparable to the well-known  halva ) is a popular confection served during special occasions, [8]  such as  Eid  celebrations or wedding receptions.  Xalwo  is made from  sugar ,  cornstarch ,  cardamom  powder,  nutmeg  powder, and  ghee . Peanuts are also sometimes added to enhance texture and flavor. [9]  In the south there is a rice pudding called  ruz bil laban . 
 Gashaato ,  kashaato  or  qumbe , made from  coconut , sugar and  oil , which is spiced with cardamom, is a much-loved sweet. The sugar is brought to a boil with a bit of water, then the cardamom is added, followed by shredded coconut. 
 Lows iyo sisin  is a favorite sweet in the south. It consists of a mixture of  peanuts  ( lows ) and  sesame seeds  ( sisin ) in a bed of  caramel . The confection sticks together to form a bar. 
 Jallaato , similar to the American  ice pop , is made by freezing naturally sweet fruits with a stick in the middle. More recently in Mogadishu ( Xamar ), it has grown to include  caano jallaato , which is made with milk and requires sugaring up. The word  jallaato  comes from  gelato , which is Italian for "frozen". 
 Buskut  or  buskud  comprises many different types of  cookies , including very soft ones called  daardaar  (literally "touch-touch" due to its smooth, delicate texture). 
 Doolshe  encompasses many styles of  cakes . 
 Icun  is a sweet mostly eaten by southern Somalis. It is made from sugar and flour mixed with oil and is most frequently served at weddings and for Eid. 
 Shushumow  is a fried Somali pastry with a crystallised shell which is usuallt made as a party snack. 
 Basbousa  is a traditional Somali sweet cake of Arab influence. [10]  It is made from cooked  semolina  or  farina  soaked in  simple syrup . 
 Also in the north there is  lokma , a sweet fried-dough pastry. 
 Baklava  is also eaten by some Somalis. 
 There are many sweets eaten during festive occasions, such as weddings, parties or Eid. Among these are  baalbaaloow ,  shuushuumoow ,  bur hindi ,  bur tuug , and  qumbe  (coconut), the last of which is made from coconuts mixed with sugar to form a bar.
 
 After-meal [ edit ] 
   A  dabqaad  incense burner 
 Somalis traditionally perfume their homes after meals.  Frankincense  ( luubaan ) or a prepared incense ( uunsi ) is placed on top of hot  charcoal  inside an incense burner or  censer  (a  dabqaad ) or  idin . [11]  It then burns for about ten minutes. This keeps the house fragrant for hours. The burner is made from  soapstone  found in specific areas of Somalia.
