 Food, cooking, and dining customs associated with American Jews

 American Jewish cuisine  comprises the food, cooking, and dining customs associated with  American Jews . [1]  It was heavily influenced by the cuisine of Jewish immigrants who came to the United States from Eastern Europe around the turn of the 20th century. [2] [3]  It was further developed in unique ways by the immigrants and their descendants, especially in  New York City  and other large metropolitan areas of the northeastern U.S. [4] [5] 
 
 
 History [ edit ] 
 Between 1881 and 1921, around 2.5 million Jews immigrated to the United States from  Eastern Europe . [3]   Most of them settled in large cities in the northeastern part of the country, especially  New York ,  Philadelphia ,  Boston ,  Cleveland ,  Chicago , and  Baltimore . [6]  These immigrants brought with them a well-developed culinary heritage.  The cuisine continued to evolve in America, in the homes of the immigrants and their descendants, and in  delicatessens  and  appetizing stores  in New York City and elsewhere. [1] 
 Delicatessens  were quite popular among second-generation American Jews, especially in the mid-twentieth century.  They provided a place for the patrons to socialize in a comfortable environment.  They also popularized some of the dishes now associated with American Jewish cuisine, which were affordable for their upwardly mobile customers, but which would have seemed luxurious to their European ancestors. [7] [8] [9]   Though not as numerous as they once were, delicatessens continue to be popular dining destinations. [10] [11] [12] 
 
 Kosher food [ edit ] 
 Kosher food  is food that conforms to  kashrut , i.e. Jewish dietary laws.  Under these rules, some foods – for example,  pork  and  shellfish  – are forbidden.  Any meat must come from an animal that was slaughtered using a process known as  shechita .  Jewish dietary law also prohibits the eating of  meat and milk  at the same meal.  For this purpose, "meat" means the flesh of mammals and birds, and "milk" includes dairy products such as cheese and butter.  Thus a kosher delicatessen selling  corned beef sandwiches  would not have any cheese, and a kosher bakery selling  bagels and cream cheese  would not have any meat.  Many foods are classified as  pareve  (sometimes spelled "parve") – neither meat nor milk, and therefore acceptable at any meal.  Pareve foods include fish, eggs, honey, and any edible plant. [13] [14]   Kosher commercial establishments must be closed from Friday evening to Saturday evening, during the  Jewish sabbath .
 American Jewish cuisine may or may not be kosher.  For example, some delicatessens follow Jewish dietary law in the preparation and serving of food, while others do not.  Followers of  Orthodox Judaism , the most traditional form of Judaism, generally eat only kosher food.  Some other more-observant Jews also eat kosher food most or all of the time.  However, the majority of American Jews are less observant of traditional rules, and eat non-kosher food.  According to a 2012 study by the  Pew Research Center , 22 percent of American Jews keep kosher in their homes. [15] 
 
 Kosher-style food [ edit ] 
 Kosher-style food  is food that is made in the style of kosher food but that does not necessarily conform to Jewish dietary laws.  For example, a kosher-style  hot dog  is an all-beef hot dog that is mildly spiced with garlic and other flavorings, and a kosher-style  pickle  is a sour pickle aged in brine with garlic and dill.  The term "kosher-style" may also refer to American Jewish cuisine in general. [16] 
 
 Passover [ edit ] 
 During the annual eight-day  Passover  holiday, Jews who are more traditionally observant do not eat  chametz  (leavened bread).  During Passover some American Jews eat  matzo  and other foods that conform to this restriction. [17] [18] 
 American Jews, like Jews elsewhere in the world, often participate in a  Passover seder  at the beginning of Passover.  This is a ritual meal that includes the telling of the story of Passover –  the Exodus  of the Jews from Egypt.  At a seder, the  Passover Seder plate  is a plate with special food items that are symbolic of different aspects of Passover. [19] 
 
 Ashkenazi, Sephardic, and Mizrahi cuisine [ edit ] 
 Main articles:  Jewish cuisine § Ashkenazi ,  Cuisine of the Sephardic Jews , and  Cuisine of the Mizrahi Jews 
 Around 90% of American Jews are  Ashkenazi Jews , whose ancestors came from Eastern or Central Europe, where many of them spoke  Yiddish  as their first language.  The foods commonly associated with American Jewish cuisine therefore have their origins in those regions.
 The United States also has a sizeable population of  Sephardic Jews , whose ancestors lived in Spain or Portugal, and later in other Mediterranean areas, and  Mizrahi Jews , whose ancestors lived in the Middle East or North Africa. [6] [20]   Sephardic and Mizrahi Jews have their own distinct cuisines, which, like Ashkenazi cuisine, were heavily influenced by their places of origin. [21] [22]  Although always outnumbered by their Ashkenazi counterparts, there are significant Sephardic and Mizrahi communities across America. These include the Persian Jews of Los Angeles, [23] [24]  the Moroccan Jews of Manhattan, [25]  the Turkish Jews of Seattle, [26]  and the Syrian Jews of Brooklyn. [27]  Additionally, Mizrahi and Sephardic cuisine predominates in the modern state of Israel.
 Therefore,  Middle Eastern and Mediterranean dishes such as  falafel ,  hummus ,  couscous , and  shakshouka  are also part of American Jewish cuisine. [28] [29] 
 
 Litvaks and Galitzianers [ edit ] 
 The two largest groups of Eastern European ( Ashkenazi ) Jews were  Litvaks , who lived farther to the north and east, in the area of  Lithuania , and  Galitzianers , who lived farther to the south and west, in the area of  Galicia .  Each group spoke their own dialect of  Yiddish .  According to some writers, it is sometimes possible to guess the ancestry of an American Jew by knowing their preferred style of  gefilte fish . [30]   Litvaks ate gefilte fish that was flavored with salt and pepper, while Galitzianers preferred theirs to be sweeter. [31]  The border between the areas where Litvaks and Galitzianers lived has therefore been referred to as "the gefilte fish line". [31] [30] 
 
 Popular dishes and foods [ edit ] 
   A  bagel ,  lox , and  cream cheese  sandwich, before assembly 
   Chicken soup  with  matzah balls 
   Gefilte fish  is made with fish that has been  minced  and then  poached . 
 Popular dishes in American Jewish cuisine include:
 
 Bagel  – A doughnut-shaped bread roll.  The dough is first boiled and then baked, resulting in a dense, chewy interior with a browned exterior. [32] [33] 
 A  bagel and cream cheese  is a popular pairing. [34] 
 Bialy  – A bread roll similar to a bagel, but without a hole, and somewhat less chewy as the dough is not boiled before being baked. [35] 
 Blintz  – A fried  crêpe , usually filled with  farmer cheese  and served with various toppings. [36] 
 Brisket  – An inexpensive cut of beef that is  braised  as a  pot roast . [37] 
 Challah  – A light bread made with eggs, used as regular food, and on ritual or holiday occasions. [38] 
 Chicken soup  – Chicken broth with herbs like  parsley ,  dill , or  thyme , and often with  egg noodles  added. [39] 
 Matzah balls  are sometimes added to the soup instead of, or in addition to, noodles. [39] [40] 
 Kreplach  are small dumplings that are another common addition to chicken soup. [40] 
 Chopped liver  – A  liver pâté  made with hard-boiled eggs, salt, and pepper. Served as a side dish, hence the expression, "What am I, chopped liver?" [41] 
 Corned beef  – Beef brisket that has been cured with  brine  and spices and then sliced. [39] [42] 
 Corned beef sandwich  – A common use of corned beef. 
 Gefilte fish  – Ground fish – often a combination of  carp ,  pike , and  whitefish  – that is mixed with other ingredients, formed into patties or balls, and  poached ; usually served as an appetizer. [43] [30] [31] 
 Kishke  – A large, starchy sausage made with grain, vegetables, beef or chicken fat, and spices. [44] 
 Knish  – A type of savory baked  turnover ; various fillings are used, such as potatoes or ground beef. [39] [45] 
 Kugel  – A baked  casserole  made with egg noodles or potatoes. [46] [47] 
 Latke  – A pancake made with grated potatoes and other ingredients, fried in oil. [48] 
 Lox  – A sliced  fillet  of cured  salmon .  Belly lox is cured with brine and is therefore rather salty. Nova lox is  cold-smoked .  Lox is often eaten as a sandwich, on a bagel with cream cheese. [49] 
 Mandelbrot  – A crunchy  cookie , sometimes made with  almonds , formed by baking a loaf which is then cut into small slabs and twice-baked. [50] 
 Pastrami  – Beef brisket that has been cured with brine, rubbed with pepper, garlic, and other spices, smoked, and then sliced. [39]   Like corned beef it is usually served as a sandwich. [42] 
 Pastrami on rye  – Pastrami on  rye bread  topped with spicy brown  mustard . [51] [52] 
 Rugelach  – Small baked pastries made by wrapping dough around a filling. [53] 
 Whitefish  – Smoked freshwater whitefish, either filleted or made into  whitefish salad . [54] [55]

 Dining at Chinese restaurants on Christmas [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Chinese cuisine in Jewish culture in the United States 
 The American Jewish custom of eating at  Chinese restaurants  on Christmas Day or Christmas Eve is a common stereotype portrayed in film and television, but it has a factual basis. The tradition may have arisen from the lack of other open restaurants on Christmas, as well as the close proximity to each other of Jewish and Chinese immigrants in New York City. [56] [57] [58] [59]  Another reason is the near-total absence of dairy products in Chinese food, making it easy to order a meat dish that doesn't contain dairy.
