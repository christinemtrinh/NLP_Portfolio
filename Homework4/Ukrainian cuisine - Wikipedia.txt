 Ukrainian cuisine  is the collection of the various cooking traditions of  the people of Ukraine , one of the largest and most populous European countries. It is heavily influenced by the rich dark soil ( chernozem ) from which its ingredients come and often involves many components. [1]  Traditional Ukrainian dishes often experience a complex heating process – "at first they are fried or boiled, and then stewed or baked. This is the most distinctive feature of Ukrainian cuisine". [2] 
 The  national dish  of Ukraine is  borscht , the well-known beet soup, of which many varieties exist. However,  varenyky  (boiled dumplings similar to  pierogi ) and a type of  cabbage roll  known as  holubtsi  are also national favourites and are a common meal in traditional Ukrainian restaurants. [3]  These dishes indicate the regional similarities within  Eastern European cuisine .
 The cuisine emphasizes the importance of wheat in particular, and grain in general, as the country is often referred to as the " breadbasket  of Europe". [4]  The majority of Ukrainian dishes descend from ancient peasant dishes based on plentiful grain resources such as rye, as well as staple vegetables such as potato, cabbages, mushrooms and beetroots. Ukrainian dishes incorporate both traditional Slavic techniques as well as other European techniques, a byproduct of years of foreign jurisdiction and influence. As there has been a significant  Ukrainian diaspora  over several centuries (for example, over a million  Canadians have Ukrainian heritage ), the cuisine is represented in European countries and those further afield, particularly Argentina, Brazil, and the USA.
