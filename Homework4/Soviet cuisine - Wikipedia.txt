 Soviet cuisine , the common cuisine of the  Soviet Union , was formed by the integration of the various national cuisines of the Soviet Union, in the course of the formation of the  Soviet people . It is characterized by a limited number of ingredients and simplified cooking. This type of cuisine was prevalent in  canteens  everywhere in the Soviet Union. It became an integral part of household cuisine and was used in parallel with national dishes, particularly in large cities. Generally, Soviet cuisine was shaped by Soviet eating habits and a very limited availability of ingredients in most parts of the USSR. Most dishes were simplifications of  French ,  Russian ,  Austro - Hungarian  cuisines, and cuisines from other  Eastern Bloc  nations. Caucasian cuisines, particularly  Georgian cuisine , contributed as well. Canteens run by the government were called stolovaya. [1] 
 In the  West , Soviet cuisine is frequently conflated with  Russian cuisine , though the particular national cuisine of Russia can be thought of as discrete.
 
 
 Approach [ edit ] 
   Ukrainian  borscht  with  smetana ,  pampushky , and  shkvarkas 
 An everyday Soviet  full course meal  (lunch or dinner) consisted of three  courses , typically referred to as "first", "second", and "third"; an optional  salad  was not numbered (in the  Russian cuisine , which largely formed a base for a Soviet one, salads belong to the separate  zakuski  course). In a  restaurant , one could eat anything one liked in any order, but in a typical canteen, especially in a workers' or students' canteen, one would normally have received what was called a "combined lunch" ( kompleksny obed ). The first course was a  soup  or  broth , i.e., "liquid" food (notice the difference from the  Italian cuisine , where a " primo piatto " could also include a  pasta  dish — under a Soviet approach the pasta dishes belonged to the second course). The second was some kind of "solid" food: meat,  fish , or poultry with a side dish, called "garnish" ( Russian :  гарнир ). Garnishes typically included potatoes in a variety of forms, buckwheat  kasha ,  macaroni , etc.  Bliny , baked dishes ( Russian :  запеканка   zapekanka ), or eggs could also be served as the second course (alternatively, dishes like deviled eggs may count as zakuski too). The third was theoretically a  dessert , but in the simplified canteen cooking this usually boiled down to some substantial, often sweetened drink: tea, coffee,  kompot , milk,  kefir , etc.
 
   Typical vegetable salad made of tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, and dressed with  smetana 
 Green vegetables and salads were seasonal, and with some exceptions (like  sauerkraut -based ones, as sauerkraut was available year-round) uncommon at the table. Spices were rarely used, aside from moderate amounts of mustard and black pepper, and food had a generally mild taste. There were no differences between breakfast, lunch, and dinner meals. Lunch was always consumed with a soup as a first course. A tradition of a "fish day" on Thursdays, when fish or other seafood was consumed instead of meat, was started in State-run canteens and cafeterias to alleviate a shortage of meat, but nevertheless filtered to many private households. The common approach, which still somewhat holds today in Russia is: eat a lot at each meal, few times a day. Eat nothing between meals – the reason for this was that the State-run eateries in the Soviet time was largely under the control of doctors, and the medical wisdom at the time was that snacking between major meals would ruin the appetite (especially for children) and will lead to indigestion and intestinal distress. [ citation needed ]  A typical lunch meal could consist of chicken-broth-based soup or borscht for a first course and fried meatballs or goulash served with boiled potatoes or  buckwheat   porridge  as a main course. Butter or sour cream was typically used as a sauce.
 
   Zakuski  at a celebration table 
 Holiday meals were typically derived from old French and Russian cuisines with extensive use of heavy sauces, marinated meats, and melted cheese. Mixing ingredients and extensive cooking was common, just as in classic French cuisine. Generally, much effort was made in order to prepare such meals. Often, the richness of a holiday table was an issue of honor for the family.
