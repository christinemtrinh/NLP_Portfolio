 The  Amazigh  (Berber)  cuisine  is a traditional cuisine with a varied history and influence of numerous flavours from distinct regions across North Africa. [1]  The traditional cuisine draws influences from Morocco's Atlas mountains and heavily populated Berber cities and regions, as well as Algeria's Berber cities and regions.
 Berber  cuisine differs from one area to another within  North Africa  and  West Africa ( Mauritania ). For this reason, every dish has a distinct and unique identity and taste according to the specific region it originates from in North Africa, with some dishes estimated to be more than a thousand years old. Zayanes of the region of  Khénifra  around the  Middle Atlas  have a cuisine of a remarkable simplicity. It is based primarily on corn, barley, ewe's milk, goat cheese, butter, honey, meat, and game. Popular authentic Berber preparations of  Tunisian ,  Moroccan ,  Algerian ,  and  Libyan ,  Mauritanian  cuisine include  tajine ,  couscous ,  shakshouka ,  pastilla ,  msemen ,  merguez ,  asida ,  lablabi ,  harissa ,  makroudh ,  harira ,  sfenj , and  ahriche .

 Although they are the original inhabitants of North Africa, Berbers lived in very contained communities, in spite of various incursions by  Phoenicians ,  Romans ,  Byzantines ,  Arabs ,  Ottomans  and  French . Having been subject to limited external influences, these populations lived free from factors making for  acculturation .
 Couscous  and  tajine  are the principal dishes for special feasts and celebrations.
