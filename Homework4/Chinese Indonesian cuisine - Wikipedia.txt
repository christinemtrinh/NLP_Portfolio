 Cuisine of the people of Chinese Indonesians 
 Chinese Indonesian cuisine  ( Indonesian :  Masakan Tionghoa-Indonesia ,  simplified Chinese :  印尼中华料理 ;  traditional Chinese :  印尼中華料理 ;  pinyin :  yìnní zhōnghuá liàolǐ ;  Pe̍h-ōe-jī :  Ìn-nî Tiong-hôa Liāu-lí ) is characterized by the mixture of  Chinese  with local  Indonesian style .  Chinese Indonesians , mostly descendant of  Han  ethnic  Hokkien  and  Hakka  speakers, brought their legacy of Chinese cuisine, and modified some of the dishes with the addition of Indonesian ingredients, such as  kecap manis  (sweet soy sauce),  palm sugar ,  peanut sauce ,  chili ,  santan  ( coconut milk ) and local  spices  to form a hybrid Chinese-Indonesian cuisine. Some of the dishes and cakes share the same style as in  Malaysia  and  Singapore , known as  Nyonya cuisine  by the  Peranakan .
 
 
 Chinese cuisine legacy [ edit ] 
 Chinese-Indonesian cuisine Mie goreng , a Chinese dish completely assimilated into Indonesian mainstream cuisine Mie ayam , and  pangsit goreng , a popular noodle dish in Indonesia Bakso  meatballs Kwetiau ayam , chicken and mushroom flat noodle with wonton soup and bakso Nasi tim ayam , steamed chicken rice Kwetiau siram with beef Shrimp  siomay Fresh  lumpia Kwetiau goreng  with crab 
 Chinese influences  are evident in  Indonesian food . Popular Chinese Indonesian foods include  bakmi ,  mie ayam ,  pangsit ,  bakso ,  lumpia ,  kwetiau goreng  and  mie goreng . [1] 
 Chinese culinary culture is particularly evident in Indonesian cuisine through the Hokkien, Hakka, and Cantonese  loanwords  used for various dishes. [2]  Words beginning with  bak  ( 肉 ) signify the presence of meat, e.g.  bakpau  (" meat bun "); words ending with  cai  ( 菜 ) signify vegetables, e.g.  pecai  (" Chinese white cabbage ") and  cap cai  ("mixed vegetables"). [3]  Also  mi  or  mie  ( 麵 ) signify  noodle  as in  mie goreng  ("fried noodle").
 Most of these loanwords for food dishes and their ingredients are Hokkien in origin and are used throughout the Indonesian language and  vernacular  speech of large cities. Because they have become an integral part of the local language, many Indonesians and ethnic Chinese do not recognize their Hokkien origins. Some of popular Indonesian dishes such as  nasi goreng , mie goreng, bihun, kwetiau,  lumpia  and  bakpia  can trace their origin to Chinese influence. Some food and ingredients are part of the daily diet of both the indigenous and ethnic Chinese populations as side dishes to accompany rice, the  staple food  of most of the country. [4] 
 Chinese influence is so evident in cities with large Chinese settlements since colonial era, especially in Jakarta, Cirebon, Semarang, Surabaya, Medan, Batam, Bangka, Palembang, Singkawang and Pontianak. As the result numbers of  mi  (noodle) and  tahu  (tofu) recipes were developed in these cities. Chinese influence is so evident in  Betawi people  (native Jakartans) cuisines that basically was formed as peranakan culture, as the result Betawi people held Chinese Indonesians dishes such as  asinan  and  rujak juhi  as theirs. To a certain extent,  Javanese  in Semarang, Solo, and Surabaya also willingly absorbs Chinese culinary influences, as the result they also considered Chinese-influenced dishes such as  mie goreng, lumpia, bakso,  and  tahu gunting  as theirs.
 Because  food  is so prevalent in  Chinese culture  as Chinese families often allocate their quality time to go eating out—just like banquet customs commonly found in  Chinese communities worldwide —many  Pecinan  ( Chinatowns ) in Indonesian cities are well known as the culinary hot spots of the city, with rows of shops and restaurants. As Chinese and also native Indonesians establishing their food business, many eating establishments sprung up, from humble street side cart hawker to fancy restaurants offering their specialty. Areas such as  Glodok , Pecenongan, and  Kelapa Gading  in  Jakarta ,  Kesawan , Pusat Pasar, Jalan Semarang, Asia Mega Mas, Cemara Asri and Sunggal in  Medan , Cibadak and Gardujati / Gardu Jati in  Bandung , Kya-kya Kembang Jepun in  Surabaya , and Pecinans in  Cirebon ,  Semarang  and  Solo  teem with many  warungs , shops and restaurants, not only offering Chinese Indonesian dishes, but also local and international cuisines.
 
 Adaptation to local cuisine [ edit ] 
 The Indonesian Chinese cuisine also vary with locations. For example, in different parts of  Java  the dishes are adapted to local culture and taste, in return Chinese Indonesians residing in this region also had developed a taste for local cuisine. In central Java, the food tends to be much sweeter, while in West Java it is saltier. In East Java, Chinese food there is more salty and savory with a preference of  petis  shrimp paste. In  Medan ,  North Sumatra  and also in  Pontianak ,  West Kalimantan , a more traditional Chinese style can be found. Chinese cuisine in Indonesia also have absorbed local preference of spicy food and local ingredients. For example, it is common to have  sambal  chili sauce,  acar  pickles and sprinkle of  bawang goreng  crispy fried  shallot  as condiment.
 Chinese cuisine influences on Indonesian cuisine is evident in Indonesian take on Chinese dishes, such as  mie goreng ,  lumpia ,  bakso  and  siomay . However the culinary influences is also taken another way around. Vice versa, Chinese Indonesian also been influenced by native  Indonesian cuisine . It is believed that  Lontong Cap Go Meh  is a Chinese Indonesian take on traditional  Indonesian dishes . The dish reflect the assimilation among  Chinese immigrants  with  local community . [5] 
 Because Indonesia is  Muslim  majority country, some of ingredients were replaced to create a  halal  Chinese food; by replacing  pork  with  chicken  or  beef , and replacing  lard  with  palm oil  or chicken fat. Most of Chinese eating establishments with significant Muslim native Indonesian clientele would do so. However, in Chinatowns in major Indonesian cities where there is significant Chinese and non-Muslim population, Chinese restaurants that serve pork dishes such as  babi kecap  ( pork belly  in soy sauce),  char siew , crispy roast pork, sweet pork sausage and  sate babi  (pork  satay ) are available.
 There are different styles of Chinese food in Indonesia:
 
 Traditional Chinese food, such as the  Teochew ,  Hokkian ,  Hakka  dishes. 
 Chinese-Indonesian food with recipes borrowed from local  Indonesian cuisine ,  Dutch  and other  European cuisine . 
 Chinese dishes adapted to the local culture and taste, such as replacing pork with chicken or beef to make it  halal . 
 New style Chinese food with chefs from China,  Hong Kong  or  Taiwan . 
 List of Chinese Indonesian food [ edit ] 
 Most of the times, the name of Chinese Indonesian foods are preserved from its original Chinese Hokkien name (e.g.  bakmi, bakpau, locupan, lumpia, swikee ). However, sometimes the name are derived from the translation of its meanings, ingredients or process in  Indonesian  (e.g.  babi kecap , kakap asam manis, kembang tahu, nasi tim ).
