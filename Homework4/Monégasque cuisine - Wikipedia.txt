 Monégasque cuisine  is the cuisine of the principality of  Monaco . It is a  Mediterranean cuisine  shaped by the cooking style of  Provence  and the influences of nearby  northern Italian  and  southern French  cooking, [1]  in addition to Monaco’s own culinary traditions. There is an emphasis on fresh  ingredients , with the use of seafood, vegetables and  olive oil  playing a major role in the cuisine. [2] 
 A more modern form of Monégasque cuisine has developed since the  Monte Carlo  casino-resort's conception in the mid-nineteenth century. [3]  Some now associate the cuisine with international influences,  cosmopolitanism ,  gastronomy  and  Michelin-starred  restaurants. [4]  However, recent years have also seen a revitalised interest in Monaco’s authentic local recipes and its more traditional culinary heritage. [5] 
 
 
 History [ edit ] 
 Early history [ edit ] 
 Monégasque cuisine has developed over many centuries. New ingredients were introduced into the developing cuisine from around 1000 BC, with the extensive  Mediterranean Sea  trade connecting Monaco with civilisations such as  Phoenicia ,  Greece ,  Rome  and  Carthage . [6]  Monaco was likely used as a coastal  trading post  by the ancient Greeks in 600 BC, who introduced grapes and  olives  into the region, which was already renowned for its  lemon  orchards. [7]  The region came under the rule of the Roman Empire in around 120 BC and Monaco supplied the empire with olive oil, lemons and wine.
 
 Modern history [ edit ] 
 In 1918, the Monégasque scholar, historian, writer and linguist  Louis Notari  (1879–1961) published a history of the principality, in which he expressed his concern for the preservation of Monégasque culture, including its culinary traditions. [8]  He wrote about the central role of olive, lemon and orange trees to traditional Monégasque cuisine. [9]  He attributed the disappearance of Monaco's fields of lemon and orange trees to the  urban transformation  of its landscape. [10] 
 Notari made reference to  fougasse , a  flatbread  dish, as an authentic  national food  which he believed needed to be preserved. [11]  He included his recipe for a traditional version of the pastry, which he believed was best served with  orange blossom , light  brandy , locally-grown Monégasque  almonds  and  Fenouillet-Gris , a small apple, red and white in colour, which originated from  Fenouillet  in the  Haute-Garonne   department  West of Monaco. [12]  These ingredients that Notari listed for the local  fougasse  were derived almost exclusively from Monaco's local vegetation and agricultural products.
 
 Impact of tourism on cuisine [ edit ] 
 In the 18th century, the  French Riviera ’s culinary offerings were described as "paltry" [13]  by  Tobias Smollett , who published the popular  travel book   Travels Through France and Italy  (1792) which characterised Monaco as a backward and remote  fishing town . [14] 
 Monaco's first  casino , Villa Bellevue, was founded in 1854, [15]  but the principality lacked sufficient amenities for travellers, with only one  inn  serving food and drink. [16] 
 In 1863, the entrepreneur  François Blanc  expressed his aim to reinvent the Villa Bellevue, and the Golden Square, Monte Carlo's resort-centre containing restaurants and  cafés , was inaugurated, offering  gourmet  culinary options for patrons. [17]  The following list of dishes was taken from the  Hôtel de Paris  in 1898 and is an example of a typical menu at a restaurant in Monte Carlo during the late 1890s:
 
 Saumon Fumé de Hollande 
 Ox-tail Clair en Tasse 
 Velouté de Homard au Paprika 
 Truite Saumonée à la Chambord 
 Tourte de Ris-de-Veau Brillat-Savarin 
 Selle d’Agneau de Lait Polignac 
 Pommes Dauphin 
 Petits Pois Fine-Fleur 
 Caille de Vigne à la Richelieu 
 Sorbet au Clicquot 
 Poularde Soufflée Impériale 
 Pâté de Foie Gras d’Alsace 
 Salade Aïda 
 Asperges d’Argenteuil Sauce Mousseline 
 Buisson d’Ecrevisses à la Nage 
 Crêpes Flambées au Grand Marnier 
 Ananas Givré à l’Orientale 
 Coffret de Friandises [18] 
 By 1903, restaurants in Monte Carlo were hiring celebrated chefs from across Europe to elevate their culinary offerings, which became renowned for their exorbitance and international origins. [19]  Dining options included the restaurants of the Hotel du Monte Carlo,  Ciro's , Café Riche, the Grand,  the Hermitage , the Sporting Club, the Palais du Soleil, the Helder, Aubanel's Restaurant, Restaurant Ré, the Riviera Palace and the  Hôtel de Paris . [20]  Whilst Monégasque cuisine experienced tremendous growth due to a focus on gastronomy in this period, some feared that the more traditional aspects of the cuisine would be eradicated. [21] 
 In 2010, 57.4 percent of stars awarded by the Michelin Guide were accounted for by the French regions of  Île- de-France ,  Rhône-Alpes ,  Aquitaine ,  Bretagne  and finally  Provence-Alpes-Côte-d’Azur , in which Monaco is situated. [22] 
 
 Preserving culinary traditions [ edit ] 
 In recent years, with the  globalisation  of  food cultures , [23]  there has been growing interest in the preservation of Monégasque cuisine and the return to the more traditional culinary traditions influenced by Provence. [24]  This interest in preserving culinary traditions often involves areas with strong connections to Mediterranean  cultural heritage . [25]  An area of interest is the preservation of local agricultural knowledge in the farming and production of key ingredients in Monégasque cuisine, such as fish, wine, cheese, fruit and vegetables, meat and oils. [26]  Others include the culinary significance of olives and olive-growing traditions, [27]  and the practice of purchasing fresh ingredients from local  marketplaces . [28] 
 
 Common ingredients [ edit ] 
 Fruit and vegetables [ edit ] 
 Fresh fruit is commonly consumed alone or used in desserts, and the region abounds in varieties of fruit. [29]  Common fruits include oranges and lemons from  Menton ,  Cavaillon  melons,  cherries  from  Luberon ,  apricots , table grapes,  figs ,  raspberries , bananas,  strawberries  and apples. [30] [31] 
 Many Monégasque dishes feature fresh and seasonal local vegetables, including  asparagus  in the spring,  zucchinis  and  eggplant  in the summer, pumpkin in the fall, onions, green  pepper ,  artichokes , tomatoes,  fennel ,  green beans ,  celery  and potatoes. [32]  Vegetables can be cut up and served raw as  crudités  with a  dip , such as  anchovy  paste mixed with garlic and olive oil. [33] 
 
 Meat and seafood [ edit ] 
 The nearby  coastline  means that seafood is generally more popular than meat, with varieties of freshly caught fish including  sea bass ,  tuna ,  salmon , red  snapper ,  mullet ,  anchovy ,  monkfish  and  cod . [34] [35]  Other types of seafood include octopus,  conger eel ,  prawns ,  mussel ,  squid ,  sea urchins  and  shellfish . [36] 
 The most commonly used meat in Monégasque cuisine is  lamb , which is often roasted with herbs. [37]  Beef is rarely consumed as  steaks  or  roasts , used more popularly in slow-cooked  stews  called  daubes . [38]  Wild  game , including rabbits,  boars  and birds, were popular in the past, but the decline of  hunting  has reduced the usage of game in Monégasque cuisine. [39] 
 
 Other staples [ edit ] 
 Other common ingredients in Monégasque cuisine include  nuts  such as almonds,  chestnuts  and  walnuts , herbs such as  saffron  and  basil , garlic,  anise ,  honey , butter and  jam ,  eggs  and orange blossom. [40]  The region is not as famous for cheese as the surrounding regions of France and Italy. [41]  Nonetheless, a popular choice of cheese is  Banon goat cheese , which is nutty, formed into small disks, individually wrapped in chestnut leaves, and tied up with  raffia . [42] 
 Further staples include pasta and rice, [43]  whist olives are a local product which form an integral part of Monégasque cuisine and the  Mediterranean diet . [44]

 Culinary traditions and customs [ edit ] 
 Dining at home [ edit ] 
 A  baguette  is a popular choice for breakfast. [68]  Monégasque people may choose to make a trip to the local bakery to ensure that the bread is served fresh for the first meal of the day. Instead of placing the bread into a bag, it is often carried with a piece of paper wrapped around the middle, a practice which aims to maintain its freshness. [69]  The meal may also involve other pastries such as  croissants  and  pain au chocolat . [70]   Beverages  often accompany the meal, with popular choices including freshly squeezed  orange juice  or coffee. [71] 
 Traditionally, lunch is the main meal of the day. [72]  On every Friday of the year, the traditional Monegasque lunch, or  dernā,  consists of  stocafi. [73] 
 Monégasque families are able to obtain fresh produce for home-cooked meals at the open-air markets around the principality. [74] 
 
 Dining out [ edit ] 
 In a Monégasque restaurant, a typical  menu  will consist of several  courses . [75]  The first course is a starter, or  hors d'œvres,  which generally involves a soup or a  paté . [76]  This may be followed by an entrée which is most often a fish or an  omelette  dish. [77]  The  main course  is then served, and it mainly consists of either lamb, beef, poultry or game, served with a  garni,  which is vegetables with rice or potatoes. [78]  After the main course, some restaurants' menus will include a  green salad , followed by cheese and dessert. [79]  Coffee may also be served, often by itself, rather than with the dessert. [80] 
 
 Special occasions [ edit ] 
 It is a tradition for Monégasque people to gather with others for meals during holidays and other festive celebrations. [81]  Culinary traditions in Monaco are also often linked with religious observations. [82] 
 The  blessing of the throat  is a  custom  that is observed on  St Blaise's Day  (3 February, the day after  Candlemas ). [83]  It involves attending church with a small package of dried figs, which are to be blessed before making an  infusion  consisting of  cloves , slices of apple and  cinnamon . [84]  The drinking of this beverage is believed to  miraculously  cure throat  ailments . [85] 
 On  Ash Wednesday , the traditional midday lunch meal consists of a chickpea soup, which includes garlic and herbs such as  sage  and  bay leaves  for flavouring. [86]   Lent  is also observed by the Monégasques with the preparation of a traditional dish,  barbagiuans ,  which are now consumed all year round. [87] 
 Monégasque  families  traditionally gather for a meal together after attending church on Easter day. [88]  The traditional dishes which are consumed on this day include roast  kid  and a type of chard pie known as  pasqualina . [89]  Around Easter time every year,  street vendors  sell Easter pastries known as  cannestreli,  which are decorated with red coloured hard boiled eggs wrapped with a  lattice of pastry  to imitate the appearance of  woven  baskets. [90] 
 Christmas is generally celebrated with a meal amongst family members. [91]  Traditionally, preceding the Christmas meal, families would observe the ‘ rite  of the  olive branch ’ [92]  where the youngest family member dips an olive branch into a glass of wine, before everyone takes a sip of wine. During the following meal, a range of dishes would be consumed, including  brandaminciun  (salted cod dish),  cardu  ( cardoon  or artichoke thistle) served in a  béchamel sauce , apple fritters and  fougasse. [93] 
 At the centre of the table, the family would place  u pan de Natale,  the Christmas loaf, which is ceremonially left there until  Epiphany . [94]  Thirteen traditional desserts are also left alongside the bread on the table. These dessert dishes are kept filled until Epiphany. [95]  They may include green and black grapes, three types of ground nuts, three types of  dried fruits , two  citrus  fruits, two  deep-fried  desserts, and seasonal pears and apples. [96] 
 The baking of  mariote e gali  for children is another culinary custom during Christmastime. [97]  They are made with the leftover dough from the  fougasse  and are shaped into dolls that resemble  gingerbread men . The eyes and mouth may be formed from sugared almonds, with aniseed scattered around the body of the doll. [98]
