   A plate of  injera  with various Eritrean stews 
 Eritrean cuisine  is based on  Eritrea 's native culinary traditions, but also arises from social interchanges with other regions. The local cuisine shares similarities with the  cuisine  of neighboring  Ethiopia  and the  cuisines  from other  African countries  in the region.
 
 
 Overview [ edit ] 
 Eritrean cuisine shares similarities with surrounding countries' cuisines; however, the cuisine has its unique characteristics.
 The main traditional food in Eritrean cuisine is  tsebhi  ( stew ), served with  injera  (flatbread made from  teff ,  wheat , or  sorghum  and  hilbet  (paste made from  legumes ; mainly  lentil  and  faba beans ). 
A typical traditional Eritrean dish consists of  injera  accompanied by a spicy stew, which frequently includes beef, goat, lamb or fish.
 Overall, Eritrean cuisine strongly resembles that of neighboring  Ethiopia , [1] [2]  although Eritrean cooking tends to feature more  seafood  than Ethiopian cuisine on account of its coastal location. [1]  Eritrean dishes are also frequently lighter in texture than Ethiopian meals as they tend to employ less  seasoned butter  and spices and more  tomatoes , as in  tsebhi  dorho . [ citation needed ] 
 Additionally, owing to its colonial history, cuisine in Eritrea features more  Italian  influences than are present in Ethiopian cooking, including more  pasta  specials and greater use of  curry  powders and  cumin . [3]  People in Eritrea likewise tend to drink coffee  [1]   Christian Eritreans  also drink  sowa  (a bitter fermented barley) and  mies  (a fermented honey beverage), [4]  while  Muslim Eritreans  abstain from drinking alcohol. [5] 
 
 Common foods and dishes [ edit ] 
   Kitcha fit-fit  is a staple of Eritrean cuisine. It consists of shredded, oiled, and spiced bread, often served with a scoop of fresh yogurt and topped with  berbere  (spice). 
 When eating  injera  diners generally share food from a large tray placed in the centre of a low dining table. Numerous pieces of  injera  are layered on this tray and topped with various spicy stews. Diners break into the section of  injera  in front of them, tearing off pieces and dipping them into the stews.
 The stews that accompany  injera  are usually made from beef, chicken, lamb, goat, mutton, or vegetables. Most Eritreans, with the exception of the  Saho , like their food spicy and hot.  Berbere , a mixture that consists of a variety of common and unusual herbs and spices, accompanies almost all dishes. Stews include  zigni , made with beef;  dorho tsebhi , made with chicken;  alicha , a vegetable dish made without  berbere ; and  shiro , a purée of various  legumes .
 When making  ga'at , a ladle is used to make an indentation in the dough, which is then filled with a mixture of  berbere  and melted butter,  and surrounded by milk or  yogurt . When dining, a small piece of  ga'at  is dipped into the  berbere  and the butter sauce, and then into the milk or yogurt.
 Influenced by its past as an  Italian colony , Eritrean cuisine also features unique interpretations of classic Italian dishes. [6]  Among these specialties are pasta sauces spiced with  berbere . [7] 
 
 Breakfast [ edit ] 
 Kitcha fit-fit , a dish made from pieces of a hearty pancake tossed in clarified butter and spices. The pancake is usually made of different types of flour, or dry porridge mixed with water and other seasonings. The heat can be adjusted by pouring more or less  berbere  (the hot spice) on the  kitcha  when it is finished. Normally served for breakfast with a side of yogurt or sour milk. 
 Fit-fit , made with torn up pieces of  injera  and usually leftover stew. It can also be made with a mixture of onions,  berbere , tomatoes, jalapeños and butter instead of leftover stews. Also called  fir-fir . 
   Ga'at  or  akelet  is an Eritrean porridge 
 Ga'at  or  akelet , a porridge made of flour and water, served in a bowl with an indentation made in the center where clarified butter and berbere are mixed; yogurt is normally put on the sides surrounding it. It is similar and related to other stiff African porridge dishes like  ugali ,  pap  and  fufu . [8] 
 Shahan ful , sauteed and mashed fava beans, served with onions, tomatoes, jalapeños, cumin, yogurt and olive oil. It is normally eaten with pieces of bread dipped in the dish to scoop out the bean mixture. 
 Panettone ; due to Italian influence on Eritrea, this bread is commonly served with tea or during the  coffee ceremony . 
 Lunch/dinner [ edit ] 
 Most dishes common to Eritrea are either meat-based or vegetable-based stews that are served over the spongy, fermented bread  injera .
 
 Tsebhi / Zigni —a spicy stew made with lamb, mutton, cubes of beef or ground beef and  berbere [9] 
 Dorho —a spicy stew made with  berbere  and a whole chicken 
 Qulwa / Tibsi —sauteed meat, onions, and  berbere  served with a sauce 
 Alicha —a non- berbere  dish made with potatoes, green beans, carrots, green peppers, and turmeric 
 Shiro —a stew made with ground chickpea flour, onions and tomatoes [10] 
 Birsen —lentils, often cooked with onions, spices, and tomatoes. This curry can be made with or without  berbere . 
 Hamli —sauteed spinach, garlic and onions [11]

 Beverages [ edit ] 
 Suwa  is the name for the home-brewed  beer  common in Eritrea. It is made from roasted corn, barley, and other grain and is flavored with  gesho , a type of buckthorn leaf. The beverage is often made for celebrations; a sweet  honey wine  (called  mies ) is also commonly served. The  coffee ceremony  is one of the most important and recognizable parts of  Eritrean  cultures. Coffee is offered when visiting friends, during festivities, or as a daily staple of life. If coffee is politely declined, then  tea  ( shahee ) will most likely be served.
 Even though Eritrea has a tradition of coffee drinking for centuries,  Italian -style coffee like  espresso  and  cappuccino  are extremely common in Eritrea, served in practically every bar and coffee shop in the capital  Asmara .
 The biggest brewery in the country is  Asmara Brewery , built 1939 under the name Melotti. The brewery today produces a range of beverages. A popular beverage that is common during festivities is Eritrean-style  Sambuca ; in Tigrinya it is translated to  areki . [12] [13]
