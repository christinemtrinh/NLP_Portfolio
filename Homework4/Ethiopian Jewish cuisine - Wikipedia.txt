 Cuisine of the Beta Israel (Ethiopian Jews) 
 Ethiopian Jewish cuisine  is the  cuisine  of the  Beta Israel  ( Ethiopian Jews ). The cuisine of the Ethiopian Jews is similar to the cuisine of other Ethiopians, with some variations. 
 Because  treyf  foods such as pork and shellfish are not traditionally eaten by either  Ethiopian Christians  or  Ethiopian Muslims , keeping  kosher  in Ethiopia is a largely invisible practice. However, there are some noticeable distinctions. Ethiopian Jews refrain from eating popular national dishes made from raw meat, such as  kitfo  and  gored gored . [1]  Jewish merchants in Addis Ababa five centuries ago deeply influenced Ethiopian cuisine by introducing curry powder and other aspects of Indian cooking. [2] 
 
 
 Ethiopian Kashrut [ edit ] 
 See also:  Haymanot  and  Kashrut 
 Ethiopian-Jewish  dietary laws  are based mainly on  Leviticus ,  Deuteronomy  and  Jubilees . 
 Permitted and forbidden animals and their signs appear on  Leviticus 11:3–8  and  Deuteronomy 14:4–8 . Forbidden birds are listed on  Leviticus 11:13–23  and  Deuteronomy 14:12–20 . Signs of permitted fish are written on  Leviticus 11:9–12  and  Deuteronomy 14:9–10 . Insects and larvae are forbidden according to  Leviticus 11:41–42 .  Birds of prey  are forbidden according to  Leviticus 11:13–19 . 
 Gid hanasheh  is forbidden per  Genesis 32:33 .  Mixtures of milk and meat  are not prepared or eaten but are not banned either:  Haymanot  interpreted the verses  Exodus 23:19 ,  Exodus 34:26  and  Deuteronomy 14:21  literally "shalt not seethe a kid in its mother's milk" (like the  Karaites ). Currently, under  Rabbinic  influence, mixing dairy products with meat is prohibited.
 Ethiopian Jews were  forbidden  to eat the food of  non-Jews .  A  kes  only eats meat he has  slaughtered  himself, which his hosts then prepare both for him and themselves. 
 Beta Israel who broke these taboos were ostracized and had to undergo a purification process.  Purification included fasting for one or more days, eating only uncooked chickpeas provided by the  kes , and ritual purification before entering the village. Unlike other Ethiopians, the Beta Israel do not eat raw meat dishes such as  kitfo  or  gored gored . [3] 
 Ghee  and  niter kibbeh  (types of clarified butter) are popular components of Ethiopian cuisine, including Ethiopian-Jewish cuisine. To avoid mixtures of meat and dairy, oil can be used as a  parev  substitute for  clarified butter . [4]  Kosher ghee, certified by the  Orthodox Union , is available for US markets. 
 Because excess moisture is removed from ghee through heat treatment, the heating equipment must be verified as kosher as well, which adds an extra step to the  kashering  process. [5]  Ghee is commonly used in  Middle Eastern cuisine  and thus kosher ghee is widely available in  Israel .  Yeqimem zeyet  is a form of  niter kibbeh  made from  vegetable oil  and is useful as a  parev  and  vegan  alternative to dairy-based  niter kibbeh . [6] 
 Camel meat  is traditionally eaten by Ethiopian Muslims, but it is not eaten by either Ethiopian Jews or Ethiopian Christians. Camels are not a  kosher animal .  Camel milk  is commonly consumed in Ethiopia, but is not consumed by Ethiopian Jews because it is not kosher (kosher milk must come from kosher animals).
 
 Shabbat dishes [ edit ] 
 Shabbat  is known as  Sanbat  in the  Amharic  and  Tigrinya  languages. 
 Sanbat Wat  (Sabbath Wat) is a traditional Ethiopian-Jewish  wat  that is prepared for Shabbat.  Sanbat Wat  is a  doro wat  of chicken and hard-boiled eggs served with  injera .  Sanbat Wat  is a spicy dish and is commonly seasoned with  berbere , cloves, onions, tomato sauce, and other savory ingredients. [7]   Wats  made from chicken, meat, and fish are most commonly eaten for Shabbat dinner while vegetarian  wats  are eaten for breakfast.
 Dabos , small round rolls, are traditionally served during Shabbat meals. Because Ethiopian Jews usually lacked  wine  for  kiddush ,  tallah  (a beer fermented from  gesho  leaves) was often used as a substitute. Due to the availability of  wine in Israel , Ethiopian-Israelis generally use wine for  kiddush . [8] 
 Because Ethiopian Jews traditionally interpret  halakhic  prohibitions against  cooking on Shabbat  literally, no heating of food is done on Shabbat. All foods are prepared on  Erev Shabbat  (Friday) and served room temperature. [8] 
 Ethiopian Jews who are  Shomer Shabbat  cannot perform  buna , [9]  the traditional Ethiopian  coffee ceremony , during Shabbat.  Buna  requires  lighting a fire  and thus the ceremony must be performed before or after Shabbat.
 
 Holiday foods [ edit ] 
 Passover [ edit ] 
 Ethiopian  matzah  is baked as a circular flatbread 2 feet in diameter, with a soft texture like  pita . [10] 
 While most Jews stopped the practice of the  Passover sacrifice  after the  destruction of the Second Temple , some Ethiopian Jews still continue the practice.
 
 Rosh Hashanah [ edit ] 
 Rosh Hashanah  is known as  Brenha Serkan  in Amharic, meaning "the rising of the dawn." Ethiopian Jews traditionally only observed Rosh Hashanah for one day, as opposed to the two days usually observed by Jews elsewhere in the  diaspora  and in Israel. 
 Lamb, the most expensive meat available in Ethiopia, was served for the holiday. It was customary for affluent members of the community to hold a community feast for the holiday and invite other members of the community to join. [11] 
 
 Sigd [ edit ] 
 Ethiopian Jews fast for the holiday of  Sigd . To break the fast, it is traditional to eat a lamb or chicken stew served with eggs and potatoes.
 Since meat can be scarce in Ethiopia, Ethiopian Jews usually only eat meat-based stews once a week for Shabbat, and for holidays. [12] 
 
 Ethiopian-Jewish restaurants [ edit ] 
 There are few  kosher  Ethiopian-Jewish restaurants worldwide, even in  Israel . However, more kosher Ethiopian restaurants have opened in Israel over time. Several kosher Ethiopian restaurants have opened in  Jerusalem  and  Tel Aviv . A kosher vegan Ethiopian restaurant exists in Tel Aviv. [13] 
 In  Harlem , the Tsion Cafe serves non-kosher Ethiopian-Jewish/Ethiopian-Israeli inspired cuisine. [14]  A kosher vegan Ethiopian restaurant was opened in  Brooklyn  in March 2020, certified with the "Mason Jar K"  hechsher  under the superversion of Rabbi Sam Reinstein of  Congregation Kol Israel . [15] [16] 
 As of 2019, there are no kosher restaurants in  Addis Ababa . However, the  Chabad house  in Addis Ababa offers kosher food. [17]
