 (Redirected from  Maghreb cuisine ) 
 Regional cuisine 
   Couscous , here served with vegetables and meat, is one of the most characteristic dishes of the  Maghreb . 
 Maghreb cuisine  is the cooking of the  Maghreb  region, the northwesternmost part of  Africa  along the  Mediterranean Sea , consisting of the countries of  Algeria ,  Libya ,  Mauritania ,  Morocco , and  Tunisia . 
 Well-known dishes from the region include  couscous ,  pastilla , and  tajine  stew .
 
 
 Origins [ edit ] 
   The  Maghreb 
 The cuisine of the  Maghreb , the western region of North Africa that includes  Algeria ,  Morocco ,  Tunisia  and  Libya , as well as  Mauritania , is by origin  Berber . The cuisines of Algeria, Tunisia and Libya have also been influenced by  French  and  Italian cuisine  respectively. [1] 
 
 Cuisine [ edit ] 
 In Maghrebi cuisine, the most common  staple foods  are  wheat  (for  khobz  bread [2]  and  couscous [3] ), [4]   fish ,  seafood ,  goat , [5]   lamb , [5]   beef , [5]   dates ,  almonds ,  olives  and various  vegetables  and  fruits .
 Because the region is predominantly  Muslim ,  halal  meats are usually eaten. Most dishes are spiced. [6] 
 The use of  legumes ,  nuts , fruits and  spices  is very prominent. [5]   Salt-preserved lemons  ( l'hamd mrakad ) and so-called  "oil-cured" olives  are distinctive elements of the cuisine. [4] 
 The best-known Maghrebi dish abroad is  couscous , [7]  made from wheat  semolina . [6]  The  tajine , a cooking vessel made of clay of Berber origin, is also a common denominator in this region, although the dishes and preparation methods vary widely. For example, a  tajine  in Tunisia is a baked  quiche -like dish, [8]  whereas in Morocco it is a slow-cooked  stew . [9]   Pastilla  is also an important  Andalusian dish  of the region. [10] 
 
 Spices [ edit ] 
 Spices found in this region's cuisine are  ginger ,  allspice ,  caraway ,  saffron ,  paprika ,  cloves ,  cumin ,  coriander ,  cayenne pepper  and  turmeric . [11]  Fresh  peppermint ,  parsley , or  coriander  are also very common. Spice mixtures such as  ras el hanout ,  baharat , and chili pastes like  harissa  (especially in  Tunisia ) are frequently used.
