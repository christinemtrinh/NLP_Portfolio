 Processed food designed for ease of preparation and consumption 
 "Packaged food" redirects here. Not to be confused with  Food packaging . 
 "Ready-to-eat food" redirects here. Not to be confused with  Meal, Ready-to-Eat . 
   A rack of convenience  snack foods , including  chips  (crisps in Great Britain) 
 Convenience  food , also called  tertiary processed food , is  food  that is commercially  prepared  (often through  processing ) to optimise ease of  consumption . Such food is usually ready to eat without further preparation. It may also be easily portable, have a long  shelf life , or offer a combination of such convenient traits. Although  restaurant  meals meet this definition, the term is seldom applied to them. Convenience foods include ready-to-eat dry products,  frozen foods  such as  TV dinners ,  shelf-stable foods , prepared mixes such as cake mix, and  snack foods .
 Bread ,  cheese ,  salted food  and other prepared foods have been sold for thousands of years. Other types of food were developed with improvements in  food technology . Types of convenience foods can vary by country and geographic region. Some convenience foods have received criticism due to concerns about nutritional content and how their packaging may increase solid waste in landfills. Various methods are used to reduce the unhealthy aspects of commercially produced food and fight  childhood obesity .
 Convenience food is commercially prepared for ease of consumption. [1]  Products designated as convenience food are often sold as hot, ready-to-eat dishes; as room-temperature, shelf-stable products; or as refrigerated or  frozen food  products that require minimal preparation (typically just heating). [2]  Convenience foods have also been described as foods that have been created to "make them more appealing to the consumer." [3]  Convenience foods and restaurants are similar in that they save time. [4]  They differ in that restaurant food is ready to eat, whilst convenience food usually requires rudimentary preparation. Both typically cost more money and less time compared to home cooking from scratch. [4] 
 
 
 History [ edit ] 
 Throughout history, people have bought food from  bakeries ,  creameries ,  butcher  shops and other commercial processors to save time and effort.  The  Aztec  people of Central  Mexico  utilized several convenience foods that required only adding water for preparation, which were used by travelers. [5]   Cornmeal  that was ground and dried, referred to as  pinolli , was used by travelers as a convenience food in this manner. [5] 
 Canned food  was developed in the 19th century, primarily for military use, and became more popular during  World War I .  The expansion of canning depended significantly upon the development of canneries for producing large quantities of cans very cheaply. Before the 1850s, making a can for food required a skilled  tinsmith ; afterwards, an unskilled laborer, operating a can-making machine, could produce 15 times as many cans each day. [6] 
 One of the earliest industrial-scale processed foods was  meatpacking . After the invention of a system of  refrigerator cars  in 1878, animals could be raised, slaughtered, and butchered hundreds (later thousands) of miles or kilometers away from the consumer. [6] 
 Experience in  World War II  contributed to the development of  frozen foods  and the frozen  food industry . [7]  Modern convenience food saw its beginnings in the United States during the period that began  after World War II . [8]  Many of these products had their origins in military-developed foods designed for storage longevity and ease of preparation in the battle field. Following the war, several commercial food companies had leftover manufacturing facilities, and some of these companies created new freeze-dried and canned foods for home use. [9]  Like many product introductions, not all were successful—convenience food staples such as  fish sticks  and canned  peaches  were counterbalanced by failures such as ham sticks and  cheeseburgers -in-a-can. [10]  However, this new focus on convenience foods and the use of technology in the kitchen alleviated labor that was traditionally carried out by women, and therefore meals that could be prepared quickly enabled women to exercise more control over their time. [11] 
 As of the 2010s due to increased preference for fresh, " natural ",  whole , and  organic food  and health concerns the acceptability of processed food to consumers in the United States was dropping and the reputation of major packaged food brands had been damaged. Firms responded by offering "healthier" formulations and acquisition of brands with better reputations. [12] 
 
 Types [ edit ] 
 Convenience foods can include products such as  candy ;  beverages  such as  soft drinks ,  juices  and  milk ;  nuts ,  fruits  and  vegetables  in fresh or  preserved  states;  processed meats  and  cheeses ; and  canned  products such as  soups  and  pasta  dishes. Additional convenience foods include  frozen pizza , [13]  chips [3]  such as  potato chips  (known in Britain as crisps), [13]   pretzels , [3]  and  cookies . [13] 
 These products are often sold in  portion-controlled , single-serving  packaging  designed for portability. [14] [15] 
 
 Packaged mixes [ edit ] 
   A cake mix 
 Gristmills  have produced  flour  for  baking  for thousands of years. In more recent times flour has been sold with other ingredients mixed in, as have other products ready to cook. Packaged mixes are convenience foods [16]  which typically require some preparation and cooking either in the oven or on the stove top.
 Packaged baked goods mixes typically use chemical  leaveners  (commonly referred to as baking powder [17] ), for a quick, reliable result, avoiding the requirement for time-consuming skilled labor and the climate control needed for traditional yeast breads. These packaged mixes produce a type of  quickbread .
 Examples include  cake mixes , [18]   macaroni and cheese , [19]   brownie  mixes, [20]  and  gravy  mixes. [21]  Some packaged mixes may have a high  saturated fat  content. [22] 
 
 By country [ edit ] 
   Onigiri  at a convenience store in  Kamakura ,  Japan 
 In 2007, it was noted in the book  Australia's food & nutrition 2012  that a distinct increase in convenience food consumption had been occurring in  Australia . [23] 
 In the  Republic of Ireland ,  breakfast rolls  eaten by busy workers became a symbol of the  Celtic Tiger  economic boom. [24] 
 In  Japan ,  onigiri  (rice balls) are a popular convenience food [25]   that dates for millennia — by the  Heian period  these were established enough to be mentioned in  literature . [26] [27]  Additional Japanese convenience foods include prepared  tofu  (bean curd), [28]  prepared packages of seafood [29]  and  instant   ramen  noodles. [30] 
 Canned  tuna  packed in oil is a convenience food in the  Solomon Islands . [31] 
 In Russia, frozen  pelmeni , a type of meat dumplings, adopted from Uralic peoples such as  Komi ,  Mansi  and  Udmurts , [32]  are known from at least the 18th century, and industrially produced and prepacked pelmeni are a staple of the supermarket freezer sections.
 
 By region [ edit ] 
 In  Western Africa , processed  cassava  flour that has been grated and dried is a popular convenience food. [33] 
 
 Retail [ edit ] 
 In some instances, retail sales of convenience foods may provide higher profit margins for food retailers compared to the profits attained from sales of the individual ingredients that are present in the convenience foods. [34] 
 A survey in 1984 attributed over one-third of funds spent by consumers for food in  Britain  to be for convenience food purchases. [35] 
 
 Environmental and health concerns [ edit ] 
   Refrigerated dinner, to be heated in a microwave oven. 
 Several groups have cited the environmental harm of single serve packaging due to the increased usage of  plastics  that contributes to  solid waste  in  landfills . [36] [37]  Due to concerns about  obesity  and other health problems, some health organizations have criticized the high fat, sugar, salt,  food preservatives  and  food additives  that are present in some convenience foods. [14] 
 In most developed countries, 80% of consumed salt comes from industry-prepared food (5% come from natural salt; 15% comes from salt added during cooking or eating). [38]   Health effects of salt  concentrate on  sodium  and depend in part on how much is consumed. A single serving of many convenience foods contains a significant portion of the  recommended daily allowance  of sodium.  Manufacturers are concerned that if the taste of their product is not optimized with salt, it will not sell as well as competing products. Tests have shown that some popular packaged foods depend on significant amounts of salt for their  palatability . [39] 
 
 Labeling, mitigation, and regulation [ edit ] 
   Many preservatives, salts, artificial colors and artificial flavorings are used in this highly processed frozen food item. 
 In response to the issues surrounding the healthfulness of convenience and restaurant foods, an initiative in the United States, spearheaded by  Michelle Obama  and her  Let's Move!  campaign, to reduce the unhealthy aspects of commercially produced food and fight childhood obesity, was unveiled by the  White House  in February 2010. Mrs. Obama has pushed the industry to cut back on sugars and salts found in many convenience foods, encouraging self-regulation over government intervention through laws and regulations. [40]  Despite Mrs. Obama's stated preference on self-regulation, the  Food and Drug Administration  announced that it was looking into quantifying the guidelines into law while other groups and municipalities are seeking to add other preventative measures such as target taxes and levies onto these products. [41] [42] 
 In response to the attention, in April 2010 a coalition of sixteen manufacturers all agreed to reduce salt levels in foods sold in the United States under a program based on a similar effort in the United Kingdom. [41]  However, the initiative has met with resistance from some manufacturers, who claim that processed foods require the current high levels of salt to remain appetizing and to mask undesirable effects of food processing such as " warmed-over flavor ". [39]  The coalition expanded its mission in May 2010 by announcing that it intends to reduce the amount of calories in foods. By introducing lower calorie foods, changing product recipes and reducing portion sizes, the coalition stated that it expected to reduce the caloric content of foods by more than 1.5 trillion calories in total by 2012. [42] 
 
 Social inequality [ edit ] 
 As previously stated, convenience foods cover a variety of food groups and come in numerous forms. Thus, there are a variety of healthy and unhealthy convenience foods. Research such as the 2002 study by Kimberly Morland et al., have correlated inequalities between low-income communities and increased access to unhealthy convenience foods. This is mostly due to the destruction [ citation needed ]  of decent grocery stores in urban areas. [43] [44]  Comparing low-income communities to more affluent communities, there are four times more supermarkets located in white communities than the black communities (commonly found in  food deserts ). As a result, the 2002 study concluded that with limited access to healthy food options in supermarkets, members within the low-income and minority communities have unequal access. [43] [ non-primary source needed ]  A 2010 study by Dharma E. Cortes et al. also found a connection between consumption of unhealthy convenience food and minority communities. Limited access to healthy food options has resulted in an increase in  obesity  amongst members in these communities. [45] [ non-primary source needed ] 
 Many low-income families struggle with buying fresh fruits and vegetables and nutritional meals for their families because of the price of the products. These families are most often located in  food deserts  and fresh food is not readily available in their community. Thus, families resort to buying food that is high in fat, sugar, and salt because these highly processed options are inexpensive. These highly processed foods make up a significant portion of unhealthy convenience foods. [46]
