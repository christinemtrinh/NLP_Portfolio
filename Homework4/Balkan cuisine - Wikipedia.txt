 Regional cuisine 
   Easter breakfast is eaten in  Serbia  for  Orthodox Easter . It is also popular in  North Macedonia ,  Montenegro  and  Bosnia and Herzegovina . A similar meal is eaten in  Slovenia  but with  Slovenian potica  instead of cake. 
 Balkan cuisine  is a type of regional  cuisine  that combines characteristics of  European cuisine  with some of those from  Western Asia . It is found in the  Balkan Peninsula  of  Southeast Europe , a region without clear boundaries but which is generally considered to at least include the modern countries of Albania, Bulgaria, Romania and Greece and the former Yugoslavia, with the possible exception of Slovenia and northern inland regions of Croatia. [1] 
 Balkan cuisine can be found in Vienna as a result of post-WWII migration to that city. [2]  Germany has restaurants serving Balkan cuisine, which were often called Yugoslavian restaurants until the outbreak of the  Yugoslav Wars . [3]  There were Balkan Grills in West Germany from the 1960s, leading to the popularisation of  ćevapčići  in Germany, but these establishments have become rarer since the late 1980s and those that survive are often now called "Croatian" instead. [4]  A restaurant selling  Romani cuisine  opened in Slovenia 2014. Romani cuisine, the traditional food of the Romani people, includes dishes from traditional Balkan cuisine. [5] 
 
 
 History [ edit ] 
 The Balkans have a history of foreign rule and internal power struggles, and this has resulted in a diverse cuisine in which influences have merged as a result of cultural exchange. [6]  The historical foundation of modern Balkan cuisine is  Ottoman cuisine , which itself was heavily influenced by Arabian  Levantine cuisine  and the medieval  Byzantine cuisine . [7]  The  Ottoman Empire  introduced the use of peppers to the region and it also brought  börek , a  filo  pastry with origins that may lie in  Ancient Roman cuisine . [6]  During the Ottoman presence dishes such as  ćevapi  and  pljeskavica  were introduced along with  Turkish coffee . [8]  At the same time pork became popular in northern Serbia as pigs were not taxed under Ottoman Islamic law. [6] 
 The components of Balkan cuisine are also typically drawn from the traditional cuisines of Greece, Persia, the Arab countries and Turkey, as well as the Balkan region itself, [9]  and there has been some borrowing from  Mediterranean cuisine ,  Armenian cuisine  and the cuisines of North West Africa and Central Europe. [10]  Commonalities can be found with  German cuisine ,  Hungarian cuisine  and Slavic cuisine. [11]  The involvement of Austria, Hungary and Italy in the Balkans led to the introduction of breaded-meat dishes and  goulash  as well as an emphasis on seafood. [8]  The influence of  Persian cuisine  is shown by the use of yoghurt in meat dishes. [12]  There are also some contributions from  Jewish cuisine , such as patišpanja, the sponge cake found in Bosnia and Herzegovina. [13] 
 
 Characteristics [ edit ] 
 Balkan cuisine is characterised by very diverse, strong and spicy food. [14]  Pickled vegetables and small hot peppers are common ingredients, [15]  with peppers appearing in  ajvar  spread. [6]   Feta  cheese is also a popular ingredient. [1]  Dishes frequently make use of stuffed vegetables [8]  such as  sarma  which is made with stuffed vine leaves. Also popular is  moussaka , a dish made with eggplants or potatoes. [1]  Many dishes are served with the thick cream known as  kajmak [16]  and the egg-and-lemon sauce  avgolemono  is also widely used. [17]   Meze  are often served as appetizers as they are in  Levantine cuisine  and  Caucasian cuisine . [18]  Popular desserts include  baklava  and  halva [1]  and the fruit brandy  rakia  is often drunk. Cooking is typically done using a  sač , a type of baking lid covered with hot coals or ashes, [8]  a technique dating back to  Ancient Greek cuisine . [19] 
 
 Diversity [ edit ] 
 The similarities within Balkan cuisine are partly due to the common natural environment of the Balkans which provides similar food ingredients. [20]  Many dishes and recipes across the Balkan region are referred to using the same vocabulary, albeit with national variations. [21]  The common features of Balkan cuisine are most easily seen in the  haute cuisine  of restaurants. In contrast, meals prepared domestically reveal the cuisine's geographic variation, [1] [22]  including a series of intermediate cuisines ranging from those of North and Mediterranean Europe to that of the Middle East. [23]  The different nationalities within the Balkans create their own variations, [22]  and a dish by the same name may have different ingredients and preparation methods in different countries. [8]  Chocolate, cakes and sweet confections are popular in the North Balkans, but in the South it is seafood, honeyed sweets and pastas that indicate the area's more Mediterranean style. [22]
