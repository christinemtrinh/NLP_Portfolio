 Cookbook: Cuisine of Indonesia 
 
   Indonesia portal   Food portal v t e 
 Betawi cuisine  is rich, diverse and eclectic, [1]  in part because the  Betawi people  that create them were composed from numbers of  regional immigrants  that came from various places in the  Indonesian archipelago , as well as  Chinese ,  Indian ,  Arab , and  European  traders, visitors and immigrants that were attracted to the port city of  Batavia  (today modern  Jakarta ) since centuries ago. [2] 
 
 
 History and influences [ edit ] 
   Kerak telor  vendor selling spicy coconut omelette, a popular delicacy during  Jakarta Fair . 
 The Betawi cuisine developed and evolved with influences from various cuisine traditions brought by waves of newcomers to the port-city on the north coast of Western  Java . From the small port of  Sunda Kalapa , it grew into an active hub of international trade, primarily involving Indonesian,  Chinese ,  Indian  and  Arab  traders. By early 16th century, drawn by the  spice trade , the  Portuguese  were the first Europeans to arrive, followed by the Dutch later in the same century. During colonial  VOC  era, foreign communities were kept in enclaves under Dutch colonial rule, as the result the culinary concentration grew in each area:  Tanah Abang  for Arab cuisine, the  Glodok  and  Kuningan  area for Chinese food and Tugu in North Jakarta for Portuguese. [1] 
 Betawi cuisine is in fact really similar to  Peranakan cuisine , as both are hybrid cuisine heavily influenced by  Chinese  and  Malay , as well as Arab and European cuisine, to neighboring  Sundanese  and  Javanese cuisine .  Nasi uduk  for example, which is a savory  rice  cooked in  coconut milk  and served with several side dishes, may be a local version of the Malay dish  nasi lemak . [1]  On the other hand,  asinan , cured and brined pickled vegetables, and  rujak juhi , vegetables served with shredded dried  squid  and  peanut sauce , demonstrate Chinese influences. Because of this common heritage, some of Betawi cuisines, such as  asinan  and  lontong cap go meh , are shared with  Chinese Indonesian . Betawi cuisine also shares some recipes and dishes with neighboring  Sundanese , such as both of them are familiar with  sayur asem ,  gado-gado  ( lotek ) and  semur   jengkol . [3]  Another examples are  nasi kebuli  and  soto betawi  that uses  minyak samin  ( ghee ), which indicates  Arab  or  Muslim Indian  influences. [4] [5] 
 A gastronomy expert suggests that some Betawi dishes can describes the past condition of Betawi people reside in Batavia. For example,  kerak telor  was created due to the low quality of local  glutinous rice , with the  egg  and other toppings added to make it more tasty and satisfying.  Soto tangkar , which today is a meat soup, was mostly made from the broth of  goat  rib-cage bones in the past because meat was expensive, or the common population of Batavia were too poor to afford some meat back then. [1] [6] 
 Today, many authentic Betawi dishes are hard to find even in its native land. This is partly because as a cosmopolitan city, Jakarta also features dishes from many far-flung parts of  Indonesia , as well as international cuisines — which is a myriad dishes for Betawi cuisine to compete with. Moreover, Betawi community were pushed out of the inner city to the marginal suburbs in and around  Greater Jakarta  in the wave of development. [1]  Nevertheless, some Betawi restaurants are striving to preserve their heritage cuisine, such as rare  gabus pucung , [3]  and  pecak gabus , snakehead fish ( Channa striata ) in  pecak  sauce. [7] 
 
 Ingredients and cooking method [ edit ] 
   Cooking  nasi goreng kambing  (fried rice with goat meat) in bulk in Kebon Sirih area,  Central Jakarta . 
 Betawi cuisine uses rice as staples, numbers of its dishes are revolved around rice, either steamed, cooked in coconut milk as  nasi uduk  ( coconut rice ), or compressed as  ketupat  sayur  or  lontong  sayur  rice cakes in vegetables soup. As a  Muslim -majority community, Betawi people favour  beef ,  mutton  and  goat  meat, as they adhere to Islamic  halal  dietary-law which forbid  pork  consumption. Fishes are consumed too. Unusual for a coastal city, there are hardly any  seafood  dishes in Betawi cuisine. But there are plenty of freshwater fish dishes, using local varieties of  snakehead  fish and  carp . 
 Popular Betawi dishes include  soto betawi  (beef  offals  in milky broth),  sayur asem  (sweet and sour vegetable soup),  sop iga sapi  (beef rib soup) and  kerak telor  (spiced coconut  omelette ). Most of Betawi dishes are cooked in deep-fried, stir-fried, barbecued or braised methods, and feature a delicate balance of sweet, sour and salty flavours. [2]
