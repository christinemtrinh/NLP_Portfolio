 Naga cuisine  is the traditional cuisine of the  Naga people  of  Nagaland , India. It features  meats  and  fish , which are often  smoked ,  dried  or  fermented ।
 
 Overview [ edit ] 
 The various  Naga people  have their own cuisines, but often exchange recipes. A typical Naga meal consists of Rice, a meat dish, one or two boiled vegetable dishes, and a  chutney /pickle (Tathu). 
Rice is the main carbohydrate source in the Naga diet and this region produces a number of prized rice varieties, but rice is also imported into the region from other states.
Dried/smoked meat is a very important ingredient in Naga cuisine and has practical significance for sustenance farmers/foragers and hunters. Smoked meat is often kept for an entire year to provide  food security  for individual families.
Nagas tend to prefer boiled edible organic leaves and wild forage which makes up a large part of the diet of many Naga regions.
 Naga food tends to be spicy and there are several different varieties of chillies in Nagaland. The most notable being  Naga Morich  and  Bhut jolokia . 
The  ginger  used in the Naga cuisine is spicy, aromatic and is different from the common ginger. Garlic and ginger leaves are also used in cooking meat dishes. 
 Sichuan pepper  is also a popular spice used by the Nagas.
 
 Dishes [ edit ]
