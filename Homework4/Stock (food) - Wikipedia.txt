 Savory cooking liquid 
 For other uses, see  Stock (disambiguation) . 
 
 
   Making stock in a pot on a  stove top 
 Stock , sometimes called  bone broth , is a savory cooking liquid that forms the basis of many  dishes  – particularly  soups ,  stews , and  sauces . Making stock involves simmering animal bones, meat, seafood, or vegetables in water or wine, often for an extended period.  Mirepoix  or other aromatics may be added for more flavor.
 
 
 Preparation [ edit ] 
 Traditionally, stock is made by  simmering  various ingredients in water. A newer approach is to use a  pressure cooker . The ingredients may include some or all of the following:
 Bones:   Beef  and  chicken  bones are most commonly used; fish is also common. The flavor of the stock comes from the  bone marrow ,  cartilage  and other  connective tissue . Connective tissue contains   collagen , which is converted into  gelatin  that thickens the liquid. Stock made from bones needs to be simmered for long periods; pressure cooking methods shorten the time necessary to extract the flavor from the bones.
 Meat:  Cooked meat still attached to bones is also used as an ingredient, especially with chicken stock. Meat cuts with a large amount of connective tissue, such as shoulder cuts, are also used.
 Mirepoix:  Mirepoix is a combination of  onions ,  carrots ,  celery , and sometimes other vegetables added to flavor the stock. Sometimes, the less desirable parts of the vegetables that may not otherwise be eaten (such as carrot skins and celery cores and leaves) are used, as the solids are removed from stock.
 Herbs and spices:  The  herbs  and  spices  used depend on availability and local traditions. In classical cuisine, the use of a  bouquet garni  (or  bag of herbs ) consisting of  parsley ,  bay leaves , a sprig of  thyme , and possibly other herbs, is common.  This is often placed in a  sachet  to make it easier to remove once the stock is cooked.
 
 Types [ edit ] 
   Pouring fish stock on a stuffed fish 
 Basic stocks are usually named for the primary meat type. A distinction is usually made between  fond blanc , or white stock, made by using raw bones and mirepoix, and  fond brun , or brown stock, which gets its color by roasting the bones and mirepoix before boiling; the bones may also be coated in  tomato paste  before roasting. Chicken is most commonly used for  fond blanc , while beef or veal are most commonly used in  fond brun .
 Other regional varieties include:
 
 Dashi  is a fish stock in  Japanese cooking  made by briefly cooking fish flakes called  katsuobushi  with kelp in nearly boiling water. 
 Myeolchi yuksu  is a stock in  Korean cooking  made by briefly cooking dried anchovies with kelp in nearly boiling water. 
 Glace de viande  is stock, usually made from veal, that is highly concentrated by reduction. 
 Ham stock , common in  Cajun  cooking, is made from  ham hocks . 
 Master stock  is a Chinese stock used primarily for poaching meats, flavored with soy sauce, sugar, ginger, garlic, and other aromatics. 
 Prawn stock  is made from boiling  prawn  shells. It is used in  Southeast Asian  dishes such as  laksa . 
 Remouillage  is a second stock made from the same set of bones. 
 Bran stock  is bran boiled in water. It can be used to thicken meat soups, used as a stock for vegetable soups or made into soup itself with onions, vegetables and molasses [1] [2] 
 Stock versus broth [ edit ] 
 This section is  transcluded  from  Broth .  ( edit  |  history ) 
 See also:  Stock (food) 
 Many cooks and food writers use the terms  broth  and  stock  interchangeably. [3] [4] [5]  In 1974,  James Beard  wrote that stock, broth, and bouillon "are all the same thing". [6] 
 While many draw a distinction between stock and broth, the details of the distinction often differ. One possibility is that stocks are made primarily from animal bones, as opposed to meat, and therefore contain more  gelatin , giving them a thicker texture. [7]  Another distinction that is sometimes made is that stock is cooked longer than broth and therefore has a more intense flavor. [8]  A third possible distinction is that stock is left unseasoned for use in other recipes, while broth is salted and otherwise seasoned and can be eaten alone. [9] [10] 
 Scotch broth  is a soup which includes solid pieces of meat and vegetables. Its name reflects an older usage of the term "broth" that did not distinguish between the complete soup and its liquid component. [11] 
 
 Health claims [ edit ] 
 By early 2010s, "bone broth" had become a popular  health food  trend, due to the resurgence in popularity of dietary fat over sugar, and interest in " functional foods " to which "culinary medicinals" such as  turmeric  and  ginger  could be added. Bone broth bars, bone broth home delivery services, bone broth carts, and bone broth freezer packs grew in popularity in the United States. [12]  The fad was heightened by the 2014 book  Nourishing Broth , in which authors Sally Fallon Morell and Kaayla T. Daniel claim that the broth's nutrient density has a variety of health effects. [13] [14] 
 There is no scientific evidence to support many of the claims made for bone broth.  [14] [15]

No book does.' The reason no book does is that they are all the same thing. A stock, which is also a broth or a bouillon, is basically some meat, game, poultry, or fish simmered in water with bones, seasonings, and vegetables.
