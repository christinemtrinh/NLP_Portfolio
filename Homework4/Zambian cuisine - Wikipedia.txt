 Zambian cuisine  is largely based on  nshima , [1]  which is a food prepared from pounded white  maize .  Nshima  is part of nearly every  Zambian  meal. In addition to  nshima , Zambian cuisine includes various types of  stew , cooked  vegetables  and different types of  beer . Dried fish and insects are also eaten. [1] 
 
 
 About [ edit ] 
 Food [ edit ] 
 Zambia's  staple food  is  maize . [2]   Nshima  makes up the main component of Zambian meals and is made from pounded white maize. [3] [4]  It is served with "relish", stew and vegetables and eaten by hand (preferably the right hand). [3] [4]   Nshima  is eaten during lunch and dinner. [5]   Nshima  may be made at home, at food stalls and at restaurants. [4] [6]  In traditional communities, the making of  nshima  is a long process, which includes drying the maize, sorting the kernels, pounding it and then finally cooking it. [7] 
 The types of relish eaten with  nshima  can be very simple, such as  chibwabwa , or  pumpkin  leaves. [6] [6]  Other names for the relish are  katapa, kalembula and  tente . [5]  The relish made with green vegetables is generally known as  delele  or  thelele . [5]  A unique way to create relish relies on cooking with  chidulo  and  kutendela . [5]   Chidulo  is used in dishes made with green, leafy vegetables and also for wild mushrooms. [5]  The  chidulo  is made of burnt, dry  banana  leaves, bean stalks or maize stalks and leaves. [5]  The ashes are then collected, added to water and strained. [5]  The resulting liquid tastes like  vinegar . [5]   Kutendela  is a prepared  peanut  powder made of pounded raw peanuts and is added to the chidulo sauce. [5] 
 Ifisashi  is another common food in Zambia. [8]  It is a type of stew, made with greens and peanuts and served with nshima. [8]   Ifisashi  can be  vegetarian  or cooked meat can be added to the stew. [9]   Samp  is also eaten in Zambia. [10] 
 Kapenta , a small  sardine  from  Lake Tanganyika , has been introduced in lakes in Zambia. [11]  The fish is caught and dried to be cooked later, or it can be cooked fresh. [11]   Gizzards  are also a popular delicacy in Zambia. [12] 
 Various insects are also eaten. These include stink bugs [13]  and  mopani worms . [14] 
 
 Alcohol [ edit ] 
 In Zambia, traditional  beer  is made from maize. [15]  Individual villages once brewed their own recipes and it was shared communally. [16]  Maize beer is also brewed commercially in  Lusaka , with Chibuku and Shake-Shake being popular brands. [17] [18]  Other types of beer that are popular include Mosi and Rhino. [15] [18]  The first Zambian beer festival was held on September 25, 2009, at the Barclays Sports Complex in Lusaka. [19] 
 
 History [ edit ] 
 See also:  History of Zambia 
 The use of  maize  in dishes such as  nsima  or  nshima  happened during the latter half of the 20th century. [20] 
 The  Bemba people , who live in what is now Zambia, traditionally ate what was available depending on weather patterns. [21]  Bemba meals included a type of thick  porridge  made of  millet  called  ubwali  which was eaten with "relish" called  umunani . [22]   Ubwali  was eaten with nearly every meal. [23]   Umunani  was most often a type of stew made with meat, fish, insects or vegetables. [24]  The Bemba preferred to eat  ubwali  with only one type of relish at a time. [25]  The stews made with meat and vegetables were cooked with salt and sometimes  ground-nuts . [25]  Generally, the Bemba did not eat raw food. [26]  Overall, Bemba cooking was fairly plain in taste and only occasionally acidic or spicy. [27]  Beer was an important part of social events for the Bemba people and beer was brewed often during harvest months. [28] [29] 
 Like the Bemba, the  Chewa people  also eat a  porridge , called  nsima , which is eaten with vegetables and used as a scoop. [7] 
 The  Tonga people  of the region have traditionally eaten insects which are cooked or dried. [30]
