There is also  calulu ,  moamba de galinha ,  moamba de ginguba ,  kissaca  and so many more delicious dishes. In addition, there is also the extremely popular  mukua   sorbet .
 
 
 Ingredients [ edit ] 
 Staple  ingredients include  beans and rice ,  pork  and  chicken , various  sauces , and  vegetables  such as  tomatoes ,  onions .  Spices  such as  garlic  are also frequently seen. [1]   Funge , a type of  porridge  made with  cassava  is a staple dish. [2] 
 There are many influences from  Portuguese cuisine  like the use of olive oil.  Piripiri  is a local hot sauce.
 
 Dishes [ edit ] 
   Fish  calulu , a typical dish from Angola and São Tomé e Príncipe 
   Moamba de galinha , traditional dish of Luanda—palm oil, cassava flour porridge, okra, plantains, wild spinach

   Mufete food from Angola 
 Funge  (or  funje ,  Portuguese pronunciation:  [ˈfũʒɨ̥] ) and  pirão  ( [piˈɾɐ̃w] ) are very common dishes, and in poorer households often consumed at every meal. The dish is often eaten with fish, pork, chicken, or beans.  funge de bombo  ( [dɨ ˈbõbu] ), more common in northern Angola, is a paste or  porridge  of  cassava  (also called manioc or yuca), made from cassava flour. It is gelatinous in consistency and gray in color.  Pirão , yellow in color and similar to  polenta , is made from cornflour and is more common in the south.  Fuba  ( [fuˈba] ) is the term for the flour that is used to make either  funge  and  pirão , also used to make  angu , the Brazilian polenta. Both foods are described as bland but filling and are often eaten with sauces and juices or with  gindungo  (see below), a spicy condiment. [3] 
 Moamba de galinha  (or  chicken moamba ,  [ˈmwɐ̃ba dɨ ɡɐˈɫĩɲɐ] ) is chicken with  palm  paste, okra, garlic and  palm oil  hash or red palm oil sauce, often served with rice and  funge . Both  funge  and  moamba de galinha  have been considered the  national dish . [3] [4]  A variant dish of  moamba de galinha ,  moamba de ginguba , uses  ginguba  ( [ʒĩˈɡubɐ] , peanut sauce) instead of palm paste. [3] [5]

 A number of  beverages ,  alcoholic  and non-alcoholic, are typical to Angola. [3] 
 Various homemade  spirits  are made, including  capatica  (made from bananas, a Cuanza Norte specialty),  caporoto  (made from maize, a Malanje specialty);  cazi  or  caxipembe  (made from potato and cassava skin);  kimbombo  (made from corn),  maluva  or  ocisangua  (made with palm tree juice, sometimes described as " palm wine ," [1]  a Northern Angola specialty),  ngonguenha  (made from toasted manioc flour), and  ualende  (made from  sugarcane , sweet potato, corn, or fruits, a  Bie  specialty).

 Popular non-alcoholic drinks including  Kissangua , a Southern Angola specialty, a traditional non-alcoholic drink made of cornflour, have been used in indigenous healing rituals. [3] [14]   Soft drinks  such as  Coca-Cola ,  Pepsi ,  Mirinda ,  Sprite , and  Fanta  are also popular. While some soft-drinks are imported from  South Africa ,  Namibia ,  Brazil , and Portugal, the Angolan soft-drink industry has grown, with Coca-Cola plants in  Bom Jesus ,  Bengo , and  Lubango  opening since 2000. [1] 
 Mongozo is a traditional homemade  beer  made from palm nuts, a specialty of the Lundas ( Lunda Norte  and  Lunda Sul ). [3]  Mongozo was brewed by the  Chokwe people  before the arrival of Europeans, and mongozo is now commercially produced for export, including to  Belgium , where it is produced by Van Steenberge. [1] 
 Various commercial beers are brewed in Angola, the oldest of which is Cuca, brewed in Luanda. Others include Eka (brewed in Dondo in  Cuanza Norte ), N'gola (brewed in Lubango), and Nocal (brewed in Luanda). [3]
