 Following  Tanganyika's  independence (1961) and unification with  Zanzibar  (1964), leading to the formation of the state of  Tanzania , President  Julius Nyerere  emphasised a need to construct a  national identity  for the citizens of the new country. To achieve this, Nyerere provided what has been regarded by some commentators as one of the most successful cases of ethnic repression and identity transformation in Africa. [1] 
 With over 130  ethnic groups  and  local languages  spoken, Tanzania is one of the most ethnically diverse countries in Africa. Despite this, ethnic divisions have remained rare in Tanzania, especially when compared to the rest of the continent.
 
 
 Natural history [ edit ] 
 The territory of Tanzania is home to some of the world's important archaeological excavations and their scientific interpretation:
 
 Olduvai Gorge [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Olduvai Gorge 
 The  Olduvai Gorge  is one of the most important  paleoanthropological  localities in the world; the many sites exposed by the gorge have proven invaluable in furthering understanding of early  human evolution . A steep-sided ravine in the  Great Rift Valley  that stretches across  East Africa , it is about 48 km (30 mi) long, and is located in the eastern  Serengeti Plains  within the  Ngorongoro Conservation Area  in the  Olbalbal  ward located in  Ngorongoro District  of  Arusha Region , about 45 kilometres (28 miles) from  Laetoli , another important archaeological locality of early human occupation. The British/Kenyan paleoanthropologist-archeologist team of  Mary  and  Louis Leakey  established excavation and research programs at Olduvai Gorge that achieved great advances in human knowledge and are world-renowned.
 In July 2019, the Olduvai Gorge Monument was erected at the turnoff to Olduvai Gorge from the road which connects Ngorongoro Conservation Area and  Serengeti National Park  (a route traveled by safari-goers). Eng. Joshua Mwankunda conceived the idea of erecting a monument to commemorate this significant site while also serving as a signpost and attracting visitors to the Olduvai Gorge and museum; paleoanthropologists  Nicholas Toth ,  Kathy Schick , and Jackson Njau planned and provided life-size fossil casts at the request of the Tanzanian government, which were used by the Tanzanian artist Festo Kijo to create the two large concrete skulls. The monument consists of two large-scale models of fossil skulls which sit atop a large pedestal with an informative plaque mounted on the side of the pedestal. The fossil skulls depicted are  Paranthropus boisei  and  Homo habilis , two contemporary species which were first discovered at Olduvai Gorge. The large-scale models created by Kijo are each 6 feet tall and weigh 5,000 pounds. The monument project was funded by the  Stone Age Institute  and the  John Templeton Foundation , in partnership with the Ngorongoro Conservation Area Authority (NCAA).
 The  Olduvai Gorge Museum , located 5 km beyond the monument, is situated on the rim of the gorge at the junction of the main gorge and the side gorge. As one of the largest onsite museums in Africa, the museum provides educational exhibits related to the gorge and its long history.
 
 Tendaguru excavations [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Tendaguru Formation 
 The  Tendaguru Formation  northwest of  Lindi  is considered the richest  Late Jurassic   strata  in  Africa . The formation has provided a wealth of fossils of different groups; early  mammaliaforms , several  genera  of  dinosaurs ,  crocodyliforms ,  amphibians ,  fish ,  invertebrates  and  flora . More than 250 tonnes (250 long tons; 280 short tons) of material was shipped to the  Museum of Natural History in Berlin , Germany, during excavations in the early twentieth century. [2] 
 The Tendaguru Beds as a fossil deposit were first discovered in 1906, when  German  pharmacist, chemical analyst and mining engineer Bernhard Wilhelm Sattler, on his way to a mine south of the Mbemkure River in former  German East Africa , was shown by his local staff enormous bones weathering out of the path near the base of Tendaguru Hill, 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) south of Mtapaia (close to Nambiranji village, Mipingo ward, 60 kilometres (37 mi) northwest of Lindi town). [3] 
 In 1998, an illustrated book in Swahili, whose title translates as  Dinosaurs of Tendaguru , was published for young readers in East Africa. It presents a slightly different, fictitious story of the first discovery, which is attributed to a Tanzanian farmer, rather than to the German engineer Sattler. [4] 
 
 Rock art formations [ edit ] 
 In February 2021, Polish archaeologists from  Jagiellonian University  announced the discovery of ancient rock art with anthropomorphic figures in a good condition at the Amak’hee 4 rockshelter site in  Swaga Swaga Game Reserve  in northwest  Dodoma Region . Paintings made with a reddish dye also contained buffalo heads, giraffe's head and neck, domesticated cattle dated back to about several hundred years ago. Archaeologists estimated that these paintings can describe a ritual of the  Sandawe people , although their present religion does not contain elements of  anthropomorphization  of buffaloes. [5] [6] [7] 
 
 Languages [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Languages of Tanzania 
 A total of 130 languages are spoken in Tanzania; most of them are from the  Bantu  family. [8]   Swahili  and  English  are the two official languages of Tanzania. However, Swahili is the national language. [9] 
 Given the conditions of the period, it was not possible to introduce Swahili in the entire educational system, because the scale of the task of writing or translating  textbooks  for primary schools was already considerable. [ citation needed ]  As a result,  English , the colonial language since the end of  World War I , is still the language of  high schools  and  universities . Many students leave school after finishing primary education.
 Although the many non-official languages in Tanzania are not actively suppressed, they do not enjoy the same  linguistic rights  as Swahili and English. Some also face  language extinction , such as the  Kw'adza language  that is not spoken any longer. [8] 
 
 Literature [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Tanzanian literature Tanzania's literary culture is primarily oral. Major oral literary forms include folktales, poems, riddles, proverbs, and songs. [10] : page 69   The greatest part of Tanzania's recorded oral literature is in Swahili, even though each of the country's languages has its own oral tradition. The country's oral literature has been declining because of the breakdown of the multigenerational social structure, making transmission of oral literature more difficult, and because increasing modernization has been accompanied by the devaluation of oral literature. [10] 
 Books in Tanzania are often expensive and hard to come by. Most Tanzanian literature is in Swahili or, less often, in English. Major figures in Tanzanian written literature include  Shaaban Robert  (considered the father of Swahili literature),  Aniceti Kitereza , Muhammed Saley Farsy, Faraji Katalambulla,  Adam Shafi Adam ,  Muhammed Said Abdalla , Said Ahmed Mohammed Khamis, Mohamed Suleiman Mohamed,  Euphrase Kezilahabi ,  Gabriel Ruhumbika ,  Ebrahim Hussein ,  May Materru Balisidya ,  Fadhy Mtanga ,  Amandina Lihamba  and  Penina O. Mlama  and British nobel laureate of Zanzibari origin  Abdulrazak Gurnah . [10] 
 
 Media [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Media of Tanzania 
 From independence until 1993, all recording and distribution of music was strictly managed by BASATA, primarily through  Radio Tanzania Dar es Salaam  (RTD). [11]  Only the 4 Tanzanian genres were permitted to be recorded or broadcast, which at the time was ngoma, taarab, kwaya and dansi. The Broadcasting Services Act of 1993 allows private broadcast networks and recording studios. [12] [13]

 Main article:  Music of Tanzania 
   Tanzanian Ngoma group 
 As in other countries, the musical in  Tanzania  is constantly undergoing changes, and varies by location, people, settings and occasion. The five music genres in Tanzania, as defined by  BASATA  are,  ngoma ,  dansi ,  kwaya , and  taarab , with  bongo flava  being added in 2001. [14] [15]  Singeli has since the mid 2000's been an unofficial music of  uswahilini , unplanned communities in  Dar es Salaam , and is the newest mainstream genre since 2020. [16] 
 Ngoma  (Bantu, meaning dance, drum and event) [17] [18]  is a traditional dance music that has been the most widespread music in Tanzania. [19] [20]  Dansi is urban jazz or band music. [19] [21]  Taarab is sung  Kiswahili  poetry accompanied by a band, typically string, in which audience is often, but not always, encouraged to dance and clap. [19]  Kwaya is choir music originally limited to church during colonization, but now an secular part of education, social, and political events. [17] [20] 
 Bongo flava is Tanzanian pop music originating in the early 2000s from  muziki wa kizazi kipya , meaning "Music of the new generation", which originated in the late 1980s. Kizazi kipya's dominant influences were  reggae ,  RnB , and  hip hop , where as the later bongo flava's dominant influences are taarab and dansi. [22]  Three recent influence on bongo flava are  Afropop  in the 2010's, as well as  amapiano  from  South Africa  and singeli from Tanzania, both since 2020. [23] [24]   Singeli is a ngoma music that originated in Manzese, a uswahilini in north-west Dar es Salaam. A MC performs over fast tempo taarab music, often at between 200-300  beets per minute (BPM)  while females dance. Styles between MC gender typically differ significantly. Male MCs usually perform in fast paced rap, while female MCs usually perform kwaya. [16] 
 In the few years prior to the 1993 Act hip hop had been getting somewhat established in Dar es Salaam, Arusha and Mwanza. It was transitioning from English performances of hip hop originating in uzunguni, rich areas like Oysterbay and Masaki with international schools, to Kiswahili performances of kizazi kipya, originating in uswahilini [25]  Following the opening of the radio waves, bongo flava spreading through out the country, and the rest of the Great Lakes. [22]

 The Tanzanian national anthem is  Mungu Ibariki Africa  (God Bless Africa), composed by South African composer  Enoch Sontonga  in 1897. [27]  The tune is the  ANC 's official song and later became the national anthem of  South Africa . The melody is also the national anthem of  Zambia . [28]  In Tanzania,  Swahili  lyrics were written for this anthem. - Another patriotic song, going back to colonial times, is  Tanzania, Tanzania .
 
 Music industry [ edit ] 
 The music industry in Tanzania has seen many changes in the past ten years. With a fusion of local and foreign music traditions, Tanzanian musicians have grown in prominence within the  African Great Lakes  region. It includes artists from traditional music, such as Dionys Mbilinyi, Sabinus Komba, and many others, to new vibrant artists in  R&B ,  pop ,  Zouk ,  Taarab , and  dance .
 Imani Sanga  is a composer, ethnomusicologist, church organist, and choral conductor.
 Mwakisinini Felix is a music artist who contributed a lot in church music as a composer, trainer, and choral conductor.
 
 Arts [ edit ] 
   A  Tingatinga  painting 
 Painting [ edit ] 
 Tingatinga  is the name applied to a popular  genre  of Tanzanian paintings, which are painted with enamel paints on canvas. Usually, the motifs are animals and flowers in colorful and repetitive design. The style was started by  Edward Saidi Tingatinga  in  Dar es Salaam . Since his death in 1972, the Tingatinga style expanded both in Tanzania and abroad. One of the most famous African artists,  George Lilanga , was a Makonde from Tanzania. Contemporary Tanzanian artists include David Mzuguno, Haji Chilonga, Salum Kambi, Max Kamundi, Thobias Minzi, Robino Ntila, John Kilaka, Godfrey Semwaiko, Evarist Chikawe, and others. [29] 
 
 Cartoons [ edit ] 
 Tanzania's cartoons have a history that can be traced back to the work of pioneering artists, such as Christian Gregory with his  Chakubanga cartoons  in the Uhuru newspaper back in the 1970s and 1980s, and Philip Ndunguru in the early 1980s. Outspokenly  political cartoons  were created on a more recent date.
 In the past decade, the art of  cartoons  and  comics  has really taken off in Tanzania. At the present date, there are dozens of  cartoonists , some of whom are well known throughout the country. From the 1960s and so on, a number of artists prepared the way, and their names are cited by today's artists as essential influences. Some of these known cartoonists in Tanzania include Ally Masoud 'kipanya', Sammi Mwamkinga, Nathan Mpangala 'Kijasti', King kinya, Adam Lutta, Fred Halla, James Gayo, Robert Mwampembwa, Francis Bonda, Popa Matumula, Noah Yongolo, Oscar Makoye, Fadhili Mohamed, and many others (see the excellent history of cartoons in Tanzania at the Worldcomics website:  http://www.worldcomics.fi )
 
 Sculpture [ edit ] 
 See also:  Makonde art 
 Apart from being a painter,  George Lilanga , who died in 2005, was also one of Tanzania's most famous sculptors. Tanzanian craftsmen and artists of different ethnic groups have created a rich legacy of sculptures, representing people, animals or practical items of everyday use. Best known of these different ethnic traditions are the Makonde carvings of  surrealist  sheitani figures, made out of extremely hard  ebony  ( mapingo ) wood. [30] [31] 
 
 Sports [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Sport in Tanzania 
   National Stadium  in  Dar es Salaam . 
 Football  is very popular throughout the country. [32]  The most popular  professional football clubs  in Dar es Salaam are the  Young Africans F.C.  and  Simba S.C. [33]  The  Tanzania Football Federation  is the governing body for football in the country.
 Other popular sports include  basketball ,  netball , boxing,  volleyball ,  athletics , and  rugby . [32] [34]  The National Sports Council also known as Baraza la Michezo la Taifa is the governing body for sports in the country under the Ministry of Information, Youth, Sports and Culture. [35]

 Tanzanian cuisine varies by geographical region. Along the coastal regions ( Dar es Salaam ,  Tanga ,  Bagamoyo ,  Zanzibar , and  Pemba ), spicy foods are common, and there is also much use of  coconut milk . 
 Regions in Tanzania's mainland consume different foods. Some typical mainland Tanzanian foods include  wali  ( rice ),  ugali  ( maize   porridge ),  nyama choma  (grilled  meat ),  mshikaki  (marinated  beef ),  samaki  ( fish ),  pilau  (rice mixed with a variety of spices),  biriyani , and  ndizi-nyama  ( plantains  with meat). 
 Vegetables commonly used in Tanzania include  bamia  ( okra ) which is mostly eaten as a stew or prepared into traditional stew called  mlenda ,  mchicha  ( amaranthus tricolor ),  njegere  ( green peas ),  maharage  ( beans ), and  kisamvu  ( cassava  leaves). Tanzania grows at least 17 different types of bananas which are used for soup, stew, and chips. 
 Some breakfast foods typically seen in Tanzania are  maandazi  (fried doughnut), chai (tea),  chapati  (a kind of  flat bread ), porridge especially in rural areas  chipsi mayai . [36] 
 Famous Tanzanian snack foods include vi sheti ,  kashata  (coconut bars),  kabaab  ( kebab ),  sambusa  ( samosa ),  mkate wa kumimina  (Zanzibari rice bread),  vileja ,  vitumbua  (rice patties), and  bagia .
 Since a large community of Indians have migrated into Tanzania, a considerable proportion of the cuisine has been influenced by  Indian cuisine . Famous chefs, such as Mohsin Asharia, have revolutionized traditional Indian dishes, such as  kashata korma tabsi  and  voodo aloo . Many Indians own restaurants in the heart of Dar es Salaam, and have been welcomed by indigenous Tanzanians.
