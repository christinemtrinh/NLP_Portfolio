 Culinary traditions of Oman 
   Kabsa  is also known as machboos in the  Persian Gulf region . 
 Omani cuisine  is part of the  Khaleeji cuisine  and is influenced by  Arab ,  Pakistani cuisine ,  Iranian ,  Indian ,  Asian ,  Eastern Mediterranean , and  African cuisine , [1]  reflecting  Oman 's position as a vast trading empire at the intersection of traditional  spice trade  routes. [2]  Dishes are often based on  chicken ,  fish , and  lamb , as well as the staple of  rice . Most Omani dishes tend to contain a rich mixture of  spices ,  herbs , and  marinades . [3]  Omani cuisine differs from other cuisines in the  Arabian peninsula , as it is less spicy and seldom served warm. [4] 
 Pork consumption is forbidden to Muslims in Oman, in accordance with  Sharia , the Islamic law.
 
 
 Characteristics [ edit ] 
 Although Omani cuisine varies within different regions of  Oman , most dishes across the country have a staple of  curry , cooked  meat ,  rice , and  vegetables . Soups are also common and are usually made from  chicken ,  lamb , and  vegetables  (e.g. smoked  eggplant ). The main meal is usually eaten in the middle of the day, while dinner is lighter.
 
 Dishes [ edit ] 
 Harees  is  wheat  mixed with meat or chicken cooked until it forms a thick paste eaten with the fingers or a spoon and served with ghee. 
 Qabuli  is rice mixed with camel meat or chicken cooked until the meat or chicken and rice is well to be eaten and then at the end some ghee. Eaten by hand. The Qabuli is an Omani dish that originates from the governorate of  Dhofar . 
 Kahwa  is an Omani  coffee  mixed with  cardamom  powder, often served as a symbol of hospitality. It is often served with  dates  and Omani  halwa . [3] 
 Kebab  is a dish of spiced and salted skewered meat (usually  chicken  or  beef ) barbecued or grilled, served with a side of  vegetables . 
 Mashuai  is a dish consisting of a whole spit-roasted  kingfish , served with a side of  lemon  rice. 
 Machboos  is a rice dish sometimes flavored with  saffron  and cooked in the same water that the chicken or meat was cooked in. 
 Muqalab  is heart, liver, lungs, and  tripe  cooked with a variety of spices, including  cinnamon ,  cardamom ,  cloves ,  black pepper ,  ginger ,  garlic , and  nutmeg . 
 Shuwaa  is a meal eaten only on festive occasions. The dish consists of chunks of goat, sheep, cow, or camel meat marinated in a spicy date paste and roasted in a special oven, which is a pit dug in the ground. This is usually a communal activity by an entire village. The meat is flavoured with a variety of  spices , then wrapped in sacks made of dry leaves, which are in turn placed into the oven. 
 Sakhana  is a thick soup made from  wheat ,  dates ,  molasses , and  milk , typically eaten during  Ramadan . 
 Albadhinajan mae tawarikh  is a cake made from  eggplant ,  dates , and onions. 
   Omani halwa Mushaltat  is a wheat flatbread often stuffed with cheese, meat, honey or vegetables. 
 Beverages [ edit ]
