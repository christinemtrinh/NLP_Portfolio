   Various Mongolian meat dishes 
   From smallest to largest:  boortsog  cookies,  aaruul  (dried curds), and  ul boov  cakes 
 Mongolian cuisine  predominantly consists of  dairy products ,  meat , and  animal fats . The most common rural dish is cooked  mutton . In the city, steamed  dumplings  filled with meat—" buuz "— are popular.
 The extreme  continental climate  of  Mongolia  has influenced the traditional diet. Use of  vegetables  and  spices  are limited. Due to geographic proximity and deep historic ties with  China  and  Russia , Mongolian cuisine is also influenced by  Chinese  and  Russian cuisine . [1] 
 
 
 History [ edit ] 
 See also:  Society of the Mongol Empire § Food in the Mongol Empire 
 Details of the historic cuisine of the Mongolian court were recorded by  Hu Sihui  in the  Yinshan Zhengyao , known to us from the 1456  Ming Dynasty  edition manuscript, also surviving in fragments from the  Yuan dynasty . [2]  Presented to  Tugh Temür  in 1330,  at the height of Mongol power and cultural influence, the Yinshan Zhengyao is a product of the cultural exchange (notably with the Islamic heartland in  Mongol Iran ) that enriched the Mongol Empire. [3]  Food scholars consider the Yinshan Zhengyao evidence for the cultural influence of the Middle East on Mongol food culture, comparable to the  Columbian exchange . [4] 
 
 Court cuisine [ edit ] 
 Wang Yuanling  gives an eyewitness report of a feast at  Kubilai khan 's court where  kumiss  is served with scallions and onions, horse meat, roast mutton, venison, quail, pheasant, diced chicken ( tianji ) and bear meat, with red wine and  congee . [5]  According to  Marco Polo  the Mongols hunted daily in December, January and February when the court was resident at the capital, with a portion of the lions, stags, bears and wild boars sent to the court of the Khan. The Khan was said to keep trained leopards, eagles, and wolves for hunting, and very fine lions that could hunt wild boars, cattle, stags and bears.
 
 Influences [ edit ] 
 Nomadic [ edit ] 
 See also:  List of wild edible plants in Mongolian cuisine 
 Little is known of the early Mongol cuisine, other than the assumption that it would be similar to the general  pastoral nomadic  foodways of the Steppe. Mongols supplemented the staples of the pastoral nomadic diet (mostly milk and herd) with hunting and gathering, especially as stores of dry curd and cheese grew scarce in the late winter months. Sheep were the most important product of  animal husbandry , providing milk for dairy products, some  fermented  goods, and meat. Horses could provide milk for the iconic  kumys , and valued for their hearty, nutritious meat and blood. Less common herd animals were reindeers and  sarlag,  a type of  yak . [6] 
 As far as hunting, Mongols hunted the wild animals of the  steppe . The  marmot  is one such mentioned in the Yinshan Zhengyao. Grain was often limited in supply, mostly traded for or taken as pillage, although some evidence of agricultural activity is known from 12th century Western Mongolia. The importance of vegetables,  fungi  and fruits and berries is unknown, but speculated to have been significant. According to the  Secret History ,  Genghis Khan 's mother  Hoelun  was forced to resort to feeding her children from the pastures after the  Tatars  poisoned her husband  Yesugei . The context of this story implies that these types of foods were consumed only out of necessity. The roots and wild fruits mentioned are: [7]

 China [ edit ] 
 The Yinshan Zhengyao features recipes with Central Asian influence, mostly in north China. Some difference continues in the present day and dishes with lamb, fancy breads and fried dumplings are more typical of north Chinese cuisine, while fish, rice, pork and vegetables are more common in the south.
 
 Muslim [ edit ] 
 Some recipes in Yinshan Zhengyao are similar to recipes from  medieval Arabic cookbooks . Scholars have proposed a possible West to East diffusion of the cookbook. Of the extant cookbooks, the Arab texts are the earliest and the similarity of Yinshan Zhengyao along with the timing of its compilation after the Mongol conquests may support a West to East diffusion or direct influence upon the Yinshan Zhengyao content, but there is no way to rule out the possibility of an independent Chinese origin. [8]   Lactic acid fermentation  was used to preserve dairy products like the dried yogurt called  kashk  in Iran and  qimaq  in the Yinshan Zhengyao.
 
 Features [ edit ] 
 The  nomads  of  Mongolia  sustain their lives directly from the products of domesticated animals such as  cattle ,  horses ,  camels ,  yaks ,  sheep , and  goats , as well as  game . [1]  Meat is either cooked, used as an ingredient for soups and dumplings, such as  buuz ,  khuushuur ,  bansh  [ ko ] ,  manti , or dried for winter ( borts ). [1]  The Mongolian diet includes a large proportion of animal fat which is necessary for the Mongols to withstand the cold winters and their hard work. Winter temperatures are as low as −40 °C (−40 °F) and outdoor work requires sufficient energy reserves. Milk and cream are used to make a variety of beverages, as well as cheese and similar products. [9] 
 The nomads in the countryside are self-supporting on principle. Travelers will find  gers  marked as  guanz  in regular intervals near the roadside, which operate as simple restaurants. In the ger, which is a portable dwelling structure (yurt is a  Turkic  word for a similar shelter, but the name is ger in  Mongolian ), Mongolians usually cook in a cast-iron or aluminum pot on a small  stove , using wood or  dry animal dung fuel  ( argal ).
 
 Common foods [ edit ] 
 The most common rural dish is cooked  mutton , usually without any other ingredients. To accompany the meats, vegetables and flour products may be used to create side dishes as well. In the city, every other local displays a sign saying " buuz ". Those are steamed  dumplings  filled with meat. Other types of dumplings are boiled in water ( bansh  [ ko ] ,  manti ), or deep fried in  mutton  fat ( khuushuur ). Other dishes combine the meat with rice or fresh noodles made into various  stews  ( tsuivan  [ ru ] ,  budaatai khuurga ) or  noodle   soups  ( guriltai shöl ).  Sülen  is a type of hot pot dish.

 The most surprising cooking method is only used on special occasions. In this case, the meat (often together with vegetables) gets cooked with the help of stones, which have been preheated in a fire. This either happens with chunks of mutton in a sealed milk can ( khorkhog ), or within the abdominal cavity of a deboned goat or  marmot  ( boodog ).
 Milk is boiled to separate the cream ( öröm ,  clotted cream ). [9]  The remaining skimmed milk is processed into cheese ( byaslag ), dried  curds  ( aaruul ),  yogurt ,  kefir , and a light milk liquor ( shimiin arkhi ). The most prominent national beverage is  airag , which is fermented  mare 's milk. [9]  A popular cereal is  barley , which is fried and malted. The resulting flour (arvain guril) is eaten as a  porridge  in milk fat and sugar or drunk mixed in milky tea. The everyday beverage is salted milk tea ( süütei tsai ), which may turn into a robust soup by adding rice, meat, or bansh. As a result of the Russian influence during socialism,  vodka  has also gained some popularity [9]  with a surprising number of local brands (usually grain spirits) . Boortsog  or bawïrsaq is a type of  fried dough  food found in the cuisines of Central Asia, Idel-Ural, Mongolia and the Middle East. It is shaped into either triangles or sometimes spheres. The dough consists of flour, yeast, milk, eggs, margarine, salt, sugar, and fat.

 Mongolian sweets include  boortsog , a type of  biscuit  or  cookie  eaten on special occasions.
 Vodka  is the most popular alcoholic beverage;  Chinggis vodka  (named for  Genghis Khan ) is the most popular brand, making up 30% of the distilled spirits market. [10] 
 
 Custom of hospitality [ edit ] 
 The Mongol people had rules of hospitality and social support similar to the Germanic  Gastfreundschaft  (where it was customary to extend hospitality even to enemies). An account of this survives  in the  Secret History of the Mongols :
 
 After that, when Dobun-mergen one day went to hunt on Toqocaq Rise, he encountered Uriangqadai people in the forest. They had killed a three year old deer and were cooking its ribs and intestines. When Dobun-mergen spoke he said: "Please give me (some meat) as the share of meat due another ( nökör sirolqa ke'ejü'ü )." Taking [only] half a breast side of the meat with the lungs, and the hide, they gave all (the rest of the) three year old deer's meat to Dobun-mergen.
