 California cuisine  is a food movement that originated in California. The cuisine focuses on dishes that are driven by local and sustainable ingredients with an attention to seasonality and an emphasis on the bounty of the region. [1] [2] 
 The food is historically chef-driven.  Dishes and meals low in  saturated fats  and high in fresh  vegetables  and  fruits  with  lean meats  and  seafood  from the  California coast  often define the style.  
 The term "California cuisine" arose as a result of culinary movements in the last decades of the 20th century and should not be confused with the  traditional foods of California . 
 French cuisine ,  American cuisine ,  Italian cuisine ,  Mexican cuisine ,  Chinese cuisine , and  Japanese cuisine  have all influenced Californian  fusion cuisine , though this is by no means a complete list of influencing cultures.
 
 
 History [ edit ] 
 One of the first proponents of using fresh, locally available foods was  Helen Evans Brown , who became friends with  James Beard  after publishing  Helen Brown's West Coast Cookbook  in 1952. She advocated using fruits and spices available in one's own neighborhood, forgoing poor grocery store substitutes, as well as fresh seafood, caught locally. 
 The book received wide acclaim and became the "template" for what is now thought of as California cuisine. [3] 
 Alice Waters , who opened  Chez Panisse  restaurant in 1971 in  Berkeley, California , has contributed significantly to the concept of California Cuisine. [4] [5] 
 About the same time, in Yountville in the Napa Valley,  Sally Schmitt [6]  began serving single-menu monthly dinners that emphasized local ingredients, continuing the concept when she and her husband Don opened  The French Laundry  in 1978. [7] 
 In Los Angeles,  Wolfgang Puck  was also an early pioneer of California cuisine; starting with his work at Patrick Terrail's [8]   Ma Maison , and further work with  Ed LaDou  on  California-style pizza  at  Spago  and  Asian fusion  at Chinois on Main. [9] 
 Mark Peel , who worked for both Waters and Puck, went on to co-found  La Brea Bakery  and  Campanile Restaurant [10]  with his then-wife  Nancy Silverton . As executive chef, he mentored other up-and-coming chefs. “Campanile has played an important role in shaping the cuisine of Southern California and beyond, not just through its menu but also through the many graduates of its kitchen.” [11] 
 Daniel Patterson , a more modern proponent of the style, [12]  emphasizes vegetables and  foraged  foods while maintaining the traditional emphasis on local foods and presentation. [13] 
 
 Specialty dishes [ edit ] 
 California-style pizza  was popularized by  Alice Waters ,  Ed LaDou  and  Wolfgang Puck  and has caught on as a national trend in the United States; pizzas focus less on tradition and more on creativity and California-grown ingredients.

 ^   "The birth of California cuisine is generally traced back to Alice Waters in the 1970s and her restaurant Chez Panisse. Waters introduced the idea of using natural, locally grown fresh ingredients to produce her dishes. California cuisine is... local, based like most traditional regional cooking on available ingredients including abundant seafood. Fresh vegetables, lightly cooked, and fresh fruits, berries, and herbs characterize the cuisine generally, but California cooking is also in fact a fusion of cooking from around the world."
