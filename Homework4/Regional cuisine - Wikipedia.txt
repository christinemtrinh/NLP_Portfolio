 Cuisine based upon national regions 
 See also:  Cuisine ,  Global cuisine , and  List of cuisines 
   Hyderabadi Biryani , a  South Asian  meat and rice dish. 
 Regional cuisine  is  cuisine  based upon national, state or local regions. [1]  Regional cuisines may vary based upon  food  availability and trade, varying  climates ,  cooking  traditions and practices, and  cultural  differences. [2]  One noteworthy definition is based upon  traditional cuisine : "A traditional cuisine is a coherent tradition of  food preparation  that rises from the daily lives and kitchens of a people over an extended period in a specific region of a country, or a specific country, and which, when localized, has notable distinctions from the cuisine of the country as a whole." [2]  Regional food preparation traditions, customs and ingredients often combine to create dishes unique to a particular region. [3]  Regional cuisines are often named after the geographic areas or regions that they originate from. [2]
