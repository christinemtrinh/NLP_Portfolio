 Sindhi cuisine  ( Sindhi : سنڌي کاڌا)  refers to the distinct native cuisine of the  Sindhi people  from  Sindh ,  Pakistan . Sindhi cuisine has been influenced by Central Asian, Iranian, Mughal food traditions. [1]  It is mostly a non-vegetarian cuisine, [2]  with even Sindhi Hindus widely accepting of meat consumption. [3]  The daily food in most  Sindhi  households consists of  wheat -based flat-bread ( phulka ) and rice accompanied by two dishes, one  gravy  and one dry with curd, papad or pickle. Freshwater fish and a wide variety of vegetables are usually used in Sindhi cuisine. [4]  Restaurants specializing in Sindhi cuisine are rare, although it is found at truck stops in rural areas of Sindh province, and in a few restaurants in urban Sindh. [5] 
 
 
 Historical influences [ edit ] 
 The arrival of  Islam  within  India  influenced the local cuisine to a great degree. Since  Muslims  are forbidden to eat pork or consume alcohol and the  Halal  dietary guidelines are strictly observed, Muslim  Sindhis  focus on ingredients such as  beef ,  lamb ,  chicken ,  fish ,  vegetables  and traditional  fruit  and  dairy . Hindu Sindhi cuisine is almost identical with the difference that beef is omitted. The influence of  Central Asian ,  South Asian  and  Middle Eastern  cuisine in Sindhi food is ubiquitous. Sindhi cuisine was also found in  India , where many  Sindhi Hindus  migrated following the  Partition of India  in 1947. Before Independence, the State of Sindh was under  Bombay Presidency .
 
   The Sindhi " Sai bhaji " is a famous curry 
   Sindhi biryani , the Sindhi variant of the  biryani  rice dish 
   Lola (Lolo in singular) prepared on Thadri festival in  Tharparkar 
 Food for special occasions [ edit ] 
 Certain dishes are served on special occasions such as Diwali a Bahji (vegetable dish) called Chiti-Kuni is made with seven vegetables. Special dishes are also served on recovery from serious illness for example when someone makes a full recovery from Chicken Pox, it is common to make an offering and make "mitho lolo", a sweet griddle-roasted flatbread: the dough is wheat flour mixed with oil (or  ghee ) and sugar syrup flavored with ground cardamom. [6] 
 
 Sai bhaji  chawal, a popular dish from Sindh consists  of white steamed rice served with spinach curry which is given a 'tarka' with tomatoes, onions and garlic. 
 Dal pakwan  (mostly consumed by Sindhi hindus) 
 Koki [7]  is another popular Sindhi flat-bread that is prepared with wheat flour and goes well with any dal, sabzi or even curd or chai. 
 Seviyan (Vermicelli), typically served as a sweetened (sometimes milk-based) dessert, is popular: Muslim Sindhis serve it on  Bakra-Eid  and  Eid ul-Fitr . On special religious occasions, mitho lolo, accompanied with milk, is given to the poor. 
   Sindhi Kadhi 
 Sindhi Kadi is a unique and special dish prepared on festive occasions specially by Sindhis residing in India. It consists of a thick spicy gravy made from chick pea flour unlike buttermilk usually used for kadi preparation along with seasonal vegetables. It is served hot with rice. 
 Mitho lolo is also served with chilled buttermilk called Matho on various occasions. 
 A special sweet dish called 'Kheer Kharkun' are prepared and served on  Eid ul-Fitr , it is prepared by mixing dates and milk, and slowly simmering the mixture for few hours. The dish is eaten hot in winters and cold in summers. 
 Taryal Patata also called Took Aloo, a staple of Sindhi diet, is a form of thinly sliced, pan fried or deep fried potatoes with local spices. They are consumed in most rural households typically at dinner but can be consumed even for breakfast and lunch alongside other meals. One popular Sindhi way of having "patatas" is to eat it with plain white rice with daal to accompany it. 
   Sindhi Fish Curry 
 Pallo Machi is a popular Sindhi delicacy, is Hilsha fish prepared with numerous cooking methods. It can be deep fried and garnished with local spices, can be cooked with onions and potatoes into a traditional fish meal or barbequed. The fish often has roe, which is called "aani" in Sindhi and is enjoyed as a delicacy. Often fried alongside the palla and served with the fish fillets. 
 Palli, is a saag or leafy green from the Chickpeas, and is enjoyed either cooked by itself like spinach or with fish cooked in the palli and called "Machi Palli". The saag has a unique flavor and is quite different from spinach or mustard saag and has a slightly sour and salty taste to it. It can take getting used to for the uninitiated.
