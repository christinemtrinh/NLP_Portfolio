 Ecuadorian cuisine  is diverse, varying with altitude and associated agricultural conditions. Ecuadorian cuisine is an amalgamation of Spanish, Andean, and Amazonian cuisines and to a lesser degree Italian, Lebanese, African, and Chinese.  Beef ,  chicken , and  seafood  are popular in the coastal regions, especially ceviche, [1]  and are typically served with carbohydrate-rich foods, such as  rice  accompanied with  lentils ,  pasta , or  plantain . In the mountainous regions  pork ,  chicken ,  beef  and  cuy  ( guinea pig ) are popular and are often served with  rice ,  maize , or  potatoes . A popular  street food  in mountainous regions is  hornado , consisting of potatoes served with roasted pig. Some examples of Ecuadorian cuisine in general include  patacones  (green  plantain  slices fried in  oil , mashed up, and then refried),  llapingachos  (a pan-seared potato ball), and  seco de chivo  (a type of stew made from  goat ). A wide variety of fresh fruit is available, particularly at lower altitudes, including  granadilla ,  passionfruit ,  naranjilla , several types of  banana ,  uvilla ,  taxo , and  tree tomato .
 The food is somewhat different in the southern mountainous areas, featuring typical  Loja  food such as  repe , a soup prepared with green bananas;  cecina , roasted  pork ; and  miel con quesillo , or " cuajada ", as dessert. In the  rainforest , a dietary staple is the  yuca , elsewhere called  cassava . The starchy root is peeled and boiled, fried, or used in a variety of other dishes. Across the nation it is also used as a bread,  pan de yuca , which is analogous to the Brazilian  pão de queijo  and its often consumed alongside different types of drinkable  yogurt . Many fruits are available in this region, including  bananas ,  tree-grapes , and  peach-palms .
 
 
 Typical meal [ edit ] 
 Most regions in Ecuador follow the traditional three-course meal of sopa/soup and segundo/second dish which includes rice or pasta and a protein such as meat, poultry, pig or fish. Then dessert and a coffee are customary. Dinner is usually lighter and sometimes just coffee or agua de remedio/herbal tea with bread.
 For the most part, Ecuador is known not only for its bananas, and all the dishes made from them, but for its starch consumption of products like  potato ,  bread ,  pasta ,  rice , and  yuca . Traditionally any of these ingredients can be found in either the soup or the rice platter that may be served.
 
 Beverages [ edit ] 
 Aguardiente , a  sugar cane -based spirit, is probably the most popular national alcohol.  Canelazo  is a popular drink made from  aguardiente .
 Drinkable  yogurt , available in many  fruit  flavors, is popular and is often consumed with  pan de yuca  (a puffy yet gooey bread roll made from cassava flour eaten hot). One traditional non-alcoholic beverage is  pinol , made using  machica  (toasted barley flour),  panela  (unrefined sugar), and spices. [2]  Another traditional non-alcoholic beverage is  colada morada , which is made with black corn flour, sweetened with  panela , and flavored with fresh fruit, herbs and spices.
 
 Catholic influence [ edit ] 
 Besides the regions, there are several typical Ecuadorian dishes consumed on special occasions.  Fanesca , a fish soup including several types of  beans ,  lentils , and  corn , is often eaten during  Lent  and  Easter , and is traditionally served all over Ecuador. During the week before the commemoration of the deceased or  All Souls' Day , the fruit beverage  colada morada  is typical, accompanied by  t'anta wawa  which is stuffed bread shaped like children.
 
 Chifa [ edit ] 
 Chifa (from the Mandarin words 吃饭, meaning "to eat rice") is the Ecuadorian term for Ecuadorian-Chinese food (or for an Ecuadorian-Chinese fusion restaurant). Because many Chinese ingredients are hard to find in Ecuador, the Chinese modified their cuisine and incorporated many Ecuadorian elements (mainly Spanish, Indigenous, and African) into their cuisine, and the popularity of chifa has made it hard to find authentic Chinese cuisine in Ecuador.
 
 Middle Eastern [ edit ] 
 Since 1875, there has been a constant flow of Lebanese immigrants to Ecuador, first fleeing the Ottoman Empire, and then the aftermath of World War I and II. By 1986, there were 97,500 Lebanese immigrants in Ecuador. Shawarma restaurants have become increasingly popular presenting another instance of fusion cuisine. Since many of the ingredient in  Middle Eastern cuisine  cannot be found in the country, Lebanese immigrants have made replacements with native ingredients. One dish that has become a staple of the country is  kibbeh . 
 One beloved Middle Eastern food that has become synonymous with Ecuadorian cuisine are yogurt drinks. The most famous are "yogures persa" brought by Persian immigrants in the 1900s. These yogurt drinks are most often accompanied by pan de yuca, which are analogous to Brazilian  pão de queijo .
 
 Desserts [ edit ] 
 Alfajores : a dessert found in virtually all of Spain's former colonies. It is derived from the versions popular in Spain during the colonial period. The original Spanish recipes, however, have been modified. The basic recipe uses a base mix of flour, margarine, and powdered sugar, which is oven-baked. Alfajores consist of two or more layers of this baked pastry, and is usually filled with  dulce de leche  (a caramel-colored, sweet, creamy filling made with milk and sugar)
 Turrones  (or nougat) is another originally Spanish dessert. 
 Arroz con leche (rice pudding): Another dessert originally from Spain that can be found in various varieties throughout Latin America. Arroz con leche is one of the more common desserts found in homes and restaurants of modern-day Ecuador. It consists primarily of cooked rice, cinnamon/nutmeg, raisins, and milk.
 Helados de Paila (ice cream): Helado de paila is a sorbet-like specialty that hails from Ibarra. It comes in an array of flavors, and it is made with fruit juice, ice, sugar, and sometimes fruits. All the ingredients are traditionally churned by hand inside a large bronze or copper pot (paila) that is placed on ice. It is said that this frozen treat was initially made with the snow from the glacier on top of the Imbabura volcano. Allegedly, Rosalía Suárez first collected the ice, and her descendants still keep the tradition alive and run an ice cream shop in Ibarra.
 Panetón or  Panettone : is a type of sweet bread with dried fruit. It was popularized by Italian immigrants that arrived in the country in the late 1800s. It is usually served for breakfast around Christmas with a cup of hot chocolate. They used to come in big boxes only with huge panetóns inside but now they also sell personal portions. Because Christmas is the hottest time of year, people often replace the hot chocolate with coffee or a drink that's served cold.
 Flan: Is a popular custard dessert with a layer of clear caramel sauce. 
 
 Drinks [ edit ] 
 Fioravanti  is a fruit-flavored, carbonated soft drink first sold in 1878 in Ecuador. It is notable for being one of the first soft drinks commercially sold. In 1991, it was acquired by The Coca-Cola Company.
 Güitig is a mineral water widely consumed around the country at times supplanting tap water as the drink of choice.
