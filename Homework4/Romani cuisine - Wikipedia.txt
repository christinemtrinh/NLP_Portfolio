 Romani cuisine  is the cuisine of the ethnic  Romani people . There is no specific "Roma cuisine"; it varies and is culinarily influenced by the respective countries where they have often lived for centuries. Hence, it is influenced by  European cuisine  even though the Romani people originated from the  Indian subcontinent . Their cookery incorporates Indian and South Asian influences, but is also very similar to  Hungarian cuisine . The many cultures that the Roma contacted are reflected in their cooking, resulting in many different cuisines. Some of these cultures are Middle European, Germany, Great Britain, and Spain. The cuisine of  Muslim Romani people  is also influenced by  Balkan cuisine  and  Turkish cuisine .
 
 
 Overview [ edit ] 
 Romani dishes are usually made hot and spicy with the use of spices, such as  paprika ,  garlic  and  bell peppers .  Potatoes  are also a staple in their diet. A traditional Romani dessert is  pirogo , which is similiar to Jewish  kugel . The recipe consists of eggs, raisins, walnuts, pineapple, sugar, butter, egg noodles and cottage cheese. [1]  Another traditional dish cooked by Romani people is  sarma ,  salmaia  or  sodmay , which is made from  cabbage  stuffed with meat and rice. [2]  Romani people consume dishes consisting of  stuffed peppers , especially on holidays and special occasions. Romani people also cook  pufe  (made from fried flour),  xaritsa  (fried cornbread),  bogacha  (baked bread) and  xaimoko  (a meal consisting of rabbit meat). They serve their meals with  kafa  (coffee) and  chao  (tea) with sugar and milk or fruits such as strawberries, peach slices, apple slices, or lemon. [3] [4]  The Roma believe some foods are auspicious and give luck (baxt). American Roma believe red pepper, black pepper, salt, vinegar, garlic, onions and a sacrificed animal such a lamb to be lucky foods. [5]  In  Maribor , Slovenia, there is a Romani restaurant called Romani Kafenava. [6]  Some itinerant European Romani people cook  hedgehog stew . [7]  Game animals and birds such as rabbits, hares, quails and partridge are consumed by the Roma.  Snails  are also consumed. [8]  Snail soup and pig stomach are Romani delicacies. Bread form an essential part of any meal. Romani food is cooked outdoors in cauldrons atop a wooden flame. [9]  Romani cuisine is also, often of necessity, inexpensive and cheap to prepare and uses portable ingredients. Thus, beef and pork are rare inclusions, while chicken and lamb and goat or wild birds and game are the preferred proteins by the Roma. Potato, peppers, cabbage and rice are often the building blocks in Romani cuisine.  Rabbit stew  is made with rabbit meat, innards, bacon and onions. [10]  The Roma consume roasted apples, almond cakes, clay-baked hedgehog and trout, snails in broth, and fig cakes as a snack. Baked hedgehog is flavored with garlic. [11]   Horse meat  is forbidden. The Roma tend to not eat at restaurants and avoid food prepared by non-Roma. [12]
