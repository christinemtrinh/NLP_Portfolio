Iraqi cuisine (Arabic: المطبخ العراقي) or Mesopotamian cuisine[1][2] is a Middle Eastern cuisine that has its origins from Sumerians, Akkadians, Babylonians, Assyrians and the other groups of the region.
[3] Tablets found in ancient ruins in Iraq show recipes prepared in the temples during religious festivals—the first cookbooks in the world.
[3][4] Ancient Mesopotamia was home to a sophisticated and highly advanced civilization, in all fields of knowledge, including the culinary arts.
[3] However, it was in the Islamic Golden Age when Baghdad was the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate (750–1258 AD) that the Iraqi kitchen reached its zenith.
[3] Throughout history, the cuisine of Iraq has made extensive contact with the cuisines of its neighbouring regions including Caucasian cuisine, Greek cuisine, Kurdish cuisine, Persian cuisine, Turkish cuisine along with traditional Arabic cuisines among others.
Today, the cuisine of Iraq reflects this rich inheritance as well as strong influences from the culinary traditions of neighbouring Iran, Turkey, and the Caucasus region.
[3] Mesopotamian cuisine varies across the country.
The cooking of Northern Iraq is known for adding pomegranate to the dolma juice prominently to give it a unique taste.
In Southern Iraq, fish is used extensively.
While in the middle region, in Baghdad and the surrounding cities is known for its variety of rice dishes and sweets.
Contemporary Iraq reflects the same natural division as ancient Mesopotamia,[5][6][7][8] which consisted of Assyria in the arid northern uplands and Babylonia in the alluvial plain.
[8] Upper Mesopotamia grows wheat and crops requiring winter chill such as apples and stone fruits.
[8] Lower Mesopotamia grows rice and barley, citrus fruits, and is responsible for Iraq's position as one of the world's largest producer of dates.
Archaeologists have found evidence from excavations at Jarmo, in northeastern Iraq, that pistachio nuts were a common food as early as 6750 BC.
[9] Among the ancient texts discovered in Mesopotamia is a Sumerian-Akkadian bilingual dictionary,[10] recorded in cuneiform script on 24 stone tablets about 1900 BC.
[10] It lists terms in the two ancient Iraqi languages for over 800 different items of food and drink.
[10] Included are 20 different kinds of cheese, over 100 varieties of soup and 300 types of bread, each with different ingredients, filling, shape or size.
[10] The world's oldest recipes are found in Mesopotamia of modern-day ancient Iraq, written in cuneiform tablets.
[11][4] One of three excavated cuneiform clay tablets written in 1700 BC in Babylon,[12][11] 50 miles south of present-day Baghdad, contains 24 recipes for stew cooked with meat and vegetables,[12] enhanced and seasoned with leeks, onion, garlic, and spices and herbs like cassia, cumin, coriander, mint, and dill.
[12] Stew has remained a mainstay in the cuisine.
[12] Extant medieval Iraqi recipes and modern Iraqi cuisine attest to this.
[12] Some characteristic ingredients of Iraqi cuisine include: Other Iraqi culinary essentials include olive oil, sesame oil, tamarind, vermicelli, tahini, honey, date syrup, yogurt and rose water.
Lamb is the favorite meat, but chicken, beef, goat and fish are also eaten.
Most dishes are served with rice—usually timman anbar, a yellowish, very aromatic, long-grain rice grown in the Middle Euphrates region.
[13] Bulghur wheat is used in many dishes, having been a staple in the country since the days of the ancient Assyrians.
[3] Flatbread is a staple that is served with a variety of dips, cheeses, olives, and jams, at every meal.
Meals begin with appetizers and salads, known as mezza.
Mezza is a selection of appetizers or small dishes often served with a beverage, like anise-flavored liqueurs such as arak, ouzo, rakı, sambuca, pastis, or various wines, similar to the tapas of Spain, or finger food.
Mezza may include: Various stews served over rice form a major part of Iraqi cuisine.
Long-grain rice is a staple in Iraqi cuisine.
[17][20] Iraqi rice cooking is a multistep process intended to produce just-tender, fluffy grains.
[13] A prominent aspect of Iraqi rice cooking is the hikakeh, a crisp bottom crust.
[13] Before serving, the hikakeh is broken into pieces so that everyone is provided with some along with the fluffy rice.
[13] The earliest known recipe for cake comes from ancient Mesopotamia.
Believed to be primarily for consumption at the palace or temple, the cake was made from fat, white cheese, dates and raisins.
Another recipe dating to the reign of Hammurabi (1792 BCE–1750 BCE) includes similar basic ingredients with the addition of grape syrup, figs and apples.
[30] The traditional Iraqi kleicha cookies are believed to have their roots in Mesopotamian qullupu—date filled pastries baked in a wood-fired oven called tannour.
In modern times, other types of cookies (biskit) and cakes (ka'ak) are made at home, usually flavored with cardamom or rose water.
Some variations include the disc-shaped khfefiyyat, half-moon shaped kleichat joz made with nuts, and date-filled kleichat tamur.
[30] Cookbooks dating to the Abbasid Caliphate between the 10th and 13th centuries include recipes for hundreds of desserts.
The tradition continues into the modern day, but the rich, syrupy desserts like baklava are usually prepared for special occasions or religious celebrations, as most daily meals are usually followed by a simple course of seasonal fruit, especially dates, figs, cantaloupes, nectarines, apricots, pomegranates, peaches, mulberries, grapes or watermelons.
[30] Though not as recognizable as baklava, the fried pastry called lauzeenaj, flavored with mastic and rose water, was a specialty in imperial Baghdad.
Rosette-shaped fritters called zalabia are a local specialty, believed to take their name from Ziryab, a well-known Iraqi musician in the Caliphate of Cordoba.
Baklava and zalabia are typical offerings during the Eid al-Fitr celebrations that follow Ramadan.
Halqoum (commonly known as Turkish delight) are traditionally given as gifts during the holiday.
[30] Others include: Alcoholic beverages in Iraq are widely available everywhere with certain exceptions in Karbala and Najaf for religious reasons.
[citation needed] Iraqis are great consumers of all kinds of alcohol except for those who follow the religious code.
