   Gyros preparation 
 Gyros —in some regions, chiefly  North America ,  anglicized  as a  gyro [2] [3] [4]  ( / ˈ j ɪər oʊ ,   ˈ dʒ ɪər -,   ˈ dʒ aɪ r -/ ;  Greek :  γύρος ,  romanized :  yíros/gyros ,  lit.   'turn',  pronounced  [ˈʝiros] )—is  meat  cooked on a vertical  rotisserie  (similar to  Doner kebab ), then sliced and served wrapped or stuffed in  pita bread , along with other ingredients such as  tomato ,  onion ,  fried potatoes , and  tzatziki . In Greece, it is normally made with  pork [5]  or sometimes with  chicken , whilst beef and lamb are also used in other countries.
 
 
 History [ edit ] 
   The earliest known photo of  doner kebab  (meat cooked on a vertical rotisserie) by  James Robertson , 1855,  Ottoman Empire 
 Grilling a vertical spit of stacked meat and slicing it off as it cooks was developed in  Bursa [6]  in the 19th century in the  Ottoman Empire , and called  doner kebab  ( Turkish :  döner kebap ). Following  World War II , doner kebab made with lamb was present in Athens, [7] [6]  introduced by immigrants from  Anatolia  and the  Middle East , [5]  possibly with the  population exchange between Greece and Turkey . [8]  The Greek version is normally made with pork and served with  tzatziki , and became known as gyros. [9] [10] 
 By 1970, gyros  wraps  were already a popular  fast food  in Athens, as well as in Chicago and New York City. [11] [12] [13]  At that time, although vertical rotisseries were starting to be mass-produced in the US by Gyros Inc. [11]  of Chicago, the stacks of meat were still hand-made. There are several claimants to have introduced the first mass-produced gyros to the United States, all based in the Chicago area in the early 1970s, and of Greek descent. One of them, Peter Parthenis, states that the mass-produced gyro was first conceptualized by John and Margaret Garlic; John Garlic was a Jewish car salesman who later ran a restaurant featuring live dolphins. [13] 
 
 Name [ edit ] 
 The name comes from the  Greek   γύρος  ( gyros , 'circle' or 'turn'), and is a  calque  of the Turkish word  döner , from  dönmek , also meaning "turn". [14]  It was originally called  ντονέρ  ( pronounced  [doˈner] ) in Greece. [9]  The word  ντονέρ  was criticized in mid-1970s Greece for being Turkish. [10]  The word  gyro  or  gyros  was already in use in American English by at least 1970, [11]  and along with  γύρος  in Greek, eventually came to replace  doner kebab  for the Greek version of the dish. [9]  Some Greek restaurants in the US, such as the Syntagma Square in New York City—which can be seen briefly in the 1976 film  Taxi Driver [15] —continued to use both  doner kebab  and  gyros  to refer to the same dish, in the 1970s. [16] 
 In Athens and other parts of southern Greece, the skewered meat dish elsewhere called  souvlaki , is known as  kalamaki , while  souvlaki  is a term used generally for gyros, and similar dishes. [17] 
 In Greek, "gyros" is a  nominative  singular noun, but the final 's' is often interpreted as an English plural, [18]  leading to the singular  back-formation  "gyro". [19]  The Greek pronunciation is  [ˈʝiɾos] , though some English speakers  pronounce it   / ˈ dʒ aɪ r oʊ / .
 
 Preparation [ edit ] 
 In Greece, gyros is normally made with pork, though other meats are used in other countries. [9]  Chicken is common, and lamb or beef may be found more rarely. [ citation needed ]  Typical American mass-produced gyros are made with finely ground beef mixed with lamb. [13] 
 For hand-made gyros, meat is cut into approximately round, thin, flat slices, which are then stacked on a spit and seasoned. Fat trimmings are usually interspersed. Spices may include  cumin ,  oregano ,  thyme ,  rosemary , and others. [ citation needed ]  The pieces of meat, in the shape of an inverted cone, are placed on a tall vertical  rotisserie , which turns slowly in front of a source of heat or  broiler . As the cone cooks, lower parts are basted with the juices running off the upper parts. The outside of the meat is sliced vertically in thin, crisp shavings when done. [9] [20] 
 The rate of roasting can be adjusted by varying the intensity of the heat, the distance between the heat and the meat, and the speed of spit rotation, thus allowing the cook to adjust for varying rates of consumption. [ citation needed ] 
 In Greece, it is customarily served in an oiled, lightly grilled piece of pita, rolled up with sliced tomatoes, chopped onions, lettuce, and  fried potatoes , sometimes topped with  tzatziki , or, sometimes in  northern Greece , ketchup or mustard. [21] [22] [23]
