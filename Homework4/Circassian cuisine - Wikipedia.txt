 Circassian cuisine  is an  ethnic cuisine , based on the cooking style and traditions of the  Circassian people  of the  North Caucasus . This region lies between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, within European Russia.
 
 
 Traditional dishes [ edit ] 
   Haliva  ( Хьэлжъо ) and  Mataz  ( Мэтазэ ), two of the prominent traditional Circassian snacks 
 Circassian  cuisine  consists of many different traditional dishes, varying by season. [1] [2]  The summer time traditional dishes are mainly  dairy products  and  vegetables . [3]  In winter and spring, the traditional dishes mostly consist of  flour  and  meat . Traditional dishes include  ficcin , seasoned  chicken  or  turkey  with sauce, boiled  mutton  and  beef  with a seasoning of sour  milk  along with salt and crushed garlic.
 Among  the many varieties of cheese in the  North Caucasus ,  Circassian cheese  is the  most popular one.
 On holidays, the Adyghe people traditionally make  Haliva  ( хьэлжъо ) from toasted millet or wheat flour.
 In the Levant, there is a widely–recognized Circassian dish known as  Tajen Alsharkaseiah . [4]
