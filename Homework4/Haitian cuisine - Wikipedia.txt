   Poul an sòs  (chicken in sauce) 
 Haitian cuisine  consists of  cooking  traditions and practices from  Haiti . It is a Creole cuisine that originates from a blend of several culinary styles that populated the western portion of the island of  Hispaniola , namely the  African ,  French , indigenous  Taíno ,  Spanish  and  Arab  influence. [1]  Haitian cuisine is comparable to that of "criollo" ( Spanish  for 'creole') cooking and similar to the rest of the  Latin Caribbean , but differs in several ways from its regional counterparts.
 The flavors are of a bold and spicy nature that demonstrate African and French influences, [2]  with notable derivatives coming from native Taíno and  Spanish  techniques.
 Levantine  influences have made their way into the mainstream culture, due to an  Arab migration  over the years. Years of adaptation have led to these cuisines to merge into Haitian cuisine. [1] 
 
 
 History [ edit ] 
 Pre-colonial cuisine [ edit ] 
 Haiti was one of many Caribbean islands inhabited by the Taíno natives, speakers of an  Arawakan  language called  Taíno . The  barbecue  originated in  Haiti . The word 'barbecue' derives from the word  barabicu , found in the language of the Taíno people of  Caribbean  and the  Timucua  of  Florida , [3]  and entered European languages in the form  barbacoa . Specifically, the  Oxford English Dictionary  translates the word as "framework of sticks set upon posts". [4] [5]  Gonzalo Fernández De Oviedo y Valdés, a Spanish explorer, was the first to use the word "barbecoa" in print in Spain in 1526 in the  Diccionario de la Lengua Española (2nd Edition) of the Real Academia Española.  After Columbus landed in the Americas in 1492, the Spaniards apparently found native Haitians roasting animal meat over a grill consisting of a wooden framework resting on sticks and a fire made underneath so that flames and smoke would rise and envelop the animal meat, giving it a certain flavor. Strangely enough, the same framework was used as a means of protection against the wild that may attack during middle of the night while at sleep. [6] [7]  The barbecue not only survived in the Haitian cuisine, but was introduced to many different parts of the world and has numerous  regional variations .
 
 Colonial cuisine [ edit ] 
 Christopher Columbus  landed at  Môle Saint-Nicolas  on 5 December 1492, and claimed the island he named  La Isla Espanola  (later named Hispaniola) for Spain. The Spanish established sugar plantations and made the natives work as slaves; however, the harsh conditions and  infectious diseases  brought over by the Spanish sailors nearly wiped out the indigenous population by 1520 as the natives lacked  immunity  to these new diseases, The Spaniards imported slaves from  Africa  to work these plantations instead. [8] [9] [10]  The Africans introduced  okra  (also called  gumbo ; edible pods),  ackee  (red and yellow fruit),  taro  (an edible root),  pigeon peas  (seeds of an African shrub), and various spices to the diet. In 1659, the French had established themselves on the western portion of the islands of Hispaniola and  Tortuga  by the way of  buccaneers . The  Treaty of Ryswick  of 1697 allowed the French to acquire the western portion of the island from the Spanish they had neglected. By the 1700s, the French had situated control comfortably, successfully cultivating sugarcane, coffee, cotton, and cocoa from the African slave labor. When the  Haitian Revolution  ended and the  First Empire of Haiti  was established in 1804, thousands of refugees from the revolution, both  whites  and  free people of color  ( affranchis  or  gens de couleur libres ), fled to  New Orleans , often bringing  African   slaves  with them, doubling the city's population. [11]  They also introduced such Haitian specialties as  red beans and rice  and  mirliton  (or  chayote ; a pear-shaped vegetable) to the  Louisiana Creole cuisine . [10] 
 Since independence from France, the French influence has remained evident in the Haitian society, not only in the usage of the language but in the contributions to the cuisine. French cheeses, breads and desserts are still common foods found at local stores and markets. [10]

 Popular foods [ edit ] 
 Haitian cuisine is often lumped together with other regional  islands as " Caribbean cuisine ", although it maintains an independently unique flavor. [10]  It involves the extensive use of herbs and the liberal use of peppers. A typical dish would probably be a plate of  riz collé aux pois  (diri kole ak pwa), which is rice with red kidney beans ( pinto beans  are often used as well) glazed with a  marinade  as a sauce and topped off with red snapper, tomatoes and  onions . It is often called the  Riz National , considered to be the national rice of Haiti.
 Rice is occasionally eaten with beans alone, but more often than not, some sort of meat completes the dish.  Bean purée  or  sauce pois  (sos pwa) is often poured on top of white rice. The traditional Haitian sauce pois is less thick than Cuban  black bean soup . Black beans are usually the beans of choice, followed by red beans, white beans, and even peas. Chicken is frequently eaten, as are  goat meat  ( cabrit ) and beef ( boeuf ). Chicken is often boiled in a marinade consisting of  lemon juice ,  sour orange ,  Scotch bonnet pepper ,  garlic  and other seasonings, then subsequently fried until crispy.
 Légume Haïtien (or simply "légume'" in Haiti), is a thick vegetable stew consisting of a mashed mixture of eggplant, cabbage,  chayote , spinach,  watercress  and other vegetables depending on availability and the cook's preference. It is flavored with  épice , onions, garlic, and tomato paste, and generally cooked with beef or crab. Légume is most often served with rice, but may also be served with other starches, including  mais moulin  (mayi moulen), a savory cornmeal porridge similar to  polenta  or  grits ),  petit mil  (cooked  millet ), or  blé  ( wheat ).
 Other starches commonly eaten include  yam ,  sweet potato ,  potato , and  breadfruit . These are frequently eaten with a thin sauce consisting of tomato paste, onions, spices, and dried fish.
 Tchaka  is a hearty stew consisting of  hominy , beans,  joumou  (squash), and meat (often  pork ).
 Boulette  are bread-bound  meatballs  seasoned in Haitian fashion. [12] 
 Spaghetti  is most often served in Haiti as a  breakfast  dish and is cooked with  hot dogs , dried  herring , and spices, then served with  tomato sauce  and sometimes raw  watercress .
 
   Haitian patties 
 One of the country's best-known appetizers is the  Haitian patty  (pâté), which are made with either ground beef, chicken,  salted cod , smoked  herring (food) , and ground turkey surrounded by a crispy or flaky crust. Other snacks include crispy, spicy fried  malanga  fritters called accra (akra),  bananes pesées , and  marinade  a fried savory dough ball. For a complete meal, they may be served with  griot  (fried pork), tassot cabrit (fried goat meat) or other fried meat. These foods are served with a spicy slaw called  pikliz  which consists of cabbage, carrot, vinegar,  scotch bonnet pepper , and spices. Fried foods, collectively known as  fritaille  (fritay), are sold widely on the streets.
 
 Regional dishes [ edit ] 
   Bowl of soup  joumou  and bread 
 Regional dishes also exist throughout Haiti. In the area around  Jérémie , in the  Grand'Anse  department at the southwest tip of the country on the  Gulf of Gonâve , a dish called  tonmtonm , which is steamed  breadfruit  called  lam veritab  mashed in a  pilon ,  is eaten. Tonmtonm is swallowed without chewing, using a slippery sauce made of  okra  (kalalou), cooked with meat, fish, crab, and savory spices. Tonmtonm is very similar to West African  fufu .  Another regional dish called  poul ak nwa  ( poulet aux noix de cajou ), which is chicken with  cashew nuts ), is from the north of the country, in the area around  Cap-Haïtien .
 Waves of migration have also influenced Haitian cuisine. For example, immigrants from  Lebanon  and  Syria  brought  kibbeh , which has been adopted into Haitian cuisine.
 The flavor base of much Haitian cooking is  épice , a combination sauce made from cooked  peppers ,  garlic , and  herbs , particularly  green onions ,  thyme , and  parsley . It is also used as a basic condiment for rice and beans and is also used in stews and soups.
 Bouillon cubes are often used by Haitian cooks, especially with the increasingly imported  Maggi  brand. [13]

 Beverages and drinks [ edit ] 
 Beer [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Prestige (beer) 
 Beer  is one of several common alcoholic beverages consumed in Haiti. The most consumed brand of beer in Haiti is  Prestige , a mild  lager . Prestige is brewed by  Brasserie Nationale d'Haiti  (owned by Heineken). [1] 
 
 Rum [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Rhum agricole 
 Haiti is known internationally for its  rum .  Rhum Barbancourt  is a well-known producer. Haitian rum is unique in that the distilleries use  sugarcane juice  directly instead of  molasses  like other types of rum, hence the added "h" in  rhum  to differentiate. The rum is marketed in approximately 20 countries and uses a process of  distillation  similar to the process used to produce  cognac . [1] 
 
 Clairin [ edit ] 
 Clairin  ( Haitian Creole :  kleren ) is a  distilled spirit , made from  cane sugar , that undergoes the same distillation process as  rhum , but is less refined. [14]  It is sometimes referred to as a white  rhum  because of the similar qualities. [15] [16] [17]  It is considered to be a cheaper option than standard  rhum  in  Haiti . It is also used in  Vodou  rituals. [14] [18] 
 
 Crémas [ edit ] 
 Crémas , also spelled  Crémasse  ( Haitian Creole :  kremas ), is a sweet and creamy alcoholic beverage native to Haiti. The beverage is made primarily from creamed coconut, sweetened condensed or evaporated milk, and rum. The rum used is usually dark; however, white rum is used frequently as well. Various other spices are added for additional flavoring such as cinnamon, nutmeg, anise, as well as miscellaneous ingredients such as the widely used vanilla extract or raisins. Recipes vary from person to person with a few differences in ingredients here and there. However the overall look and taste are the same. The beverage possesses a creamy consistency similar to a thick milkshake and varies from off-white to beige in color. It is a very popular drink, served regularly at social events and during the holidays. It is usually consumed along with a sweet pastry of some sort. The drink is often served cold however it can be served at room temperature. The beverage has become recently marketed in Haiti as well as the United States. [1] 
 
 Non-alcoholic [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Soft drinks of Haiti 
 Due to its tropical climate, juice is a mainstay in Haiti. Juices from many fruits are commonly made and can be found everywhere.  Guava  juice,  grapefruit  juice,  mango  juice, along with the juices of many citrus fruits ( orange ,  granadilla ,  passion fruit , etc.) are enjoyed. Juice is the  de facto  beverage because of its variety of flavors, easy production, and widespread accessibility. [1]   Malt beverages , which are non-alcoholic drinks consisting of unfermented  barley  with  molasses  added for flavor are commonly drunk. Fruit champagne flavored  Cola Couronne , is arguably the most popular soda in Haiti and its  diaspora , as it is a stapled beverage since 1924. [19]   Cola Lacaye  is also another brand of soda that comes in a variety of flavors including fruit cola. In the more urban areas of the nation, American beverages such as  Coca-Cola  and  PepsiCo  are also enjoyed. Milkshakes (or  milkchèyk )  are also drunk regularly. Sweet, strong coffee is enjoyed throughout the nation. Since 1898, one of the oldest coffee brands,  Café Selecto  and the more recent  Rebo,  both offer great blends. [1] [20]   Haitian coffee  has a classic and rich taste of chocolatey sweet with mellow citrus highlights. [21]  Jus Papaye is a Haitian  papaya  juice  milkshake  flavored with  vanilla . [22]   Akasan  is a popular drink in Haiti made with milk, corn flour, anise stars, vanilla and cinnamon.
 
 Desserts [ edit ] 
 Many types of desserts are eaten in Haiti ranging from the mild to sweet. Sugarcane is used frequently in the making of these desserts, although  granulated sugar  is also used often. A  shaved ice  dessert,  fresco , is similar to an  Italian ice , but consists primarily of fruit syrup.   Pain patate  (pen patat) is a soft sweet  bread  made using  cinnamon ,  evaporated milk , and  sweet potato . It is usually served cold from the refrigerator but it can also be eaten at room temperature.  Akasan  is a thick corn milkshake with a consistency similar to that of  labouille  (labouyi), a type of  cornmeal  porridge. It is made using many of the same ingredients as  pain patate  consisting of evaporated milk, and sugar. [1]   Dous Makòs  is a Haitian vanilla  fudge . [23]
