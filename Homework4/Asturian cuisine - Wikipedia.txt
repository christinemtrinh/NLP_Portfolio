   Fabada Asturiana with Sidra, a typical dish of Asturias 
 Asturian cuisine  refers to the typical dishes and ingredients found in the cuisine of the  Asturias  region of  Spain .
 
 
 Foods [ edit ] 
 Asturias is especially known for its seafood, such as fresh  squid ,  crab ,  shrimp  and  sea bass .   Salmon  are caught in Asturian rivers, notably the  Sella ; the first fish of the season is called  campanu  (Bable word for  campana ), a bell tolled to signal the first catch.
 
 Bread [ edit ] 
   Bollos preñaos 
 Spelt  bread (pan d'escanda) is very traditional. Formigos are some kind of French toasts made with crumbled bread and eggs.  Bollos preñaos  are buns filled with  chorizo . Some kind of pancakes called  frixuelos , similar to Galician filloas, are typical as dessert.  We also find specialties made with  cornmeal , such as  boroña  (round loaf of hard bread), the  fariñes , farrapes or  papes  (cornmeal porridge), the  rapa  (similar to boroña with pieces of bacon inside the dough) and tortos (cornmeal flatbread).
 
 Fruits, vegetables and legumes [ edit ] 
 The most common legume in Asturian cuisine is beans ("fabes"), the main element in the iconic  fabada  stew, one of the most well-know Asturian dishes, apart from other dishes such as beans and clams ( fabes con amasueles ). Another rich stew is  pote asturianu , with cabbage, potatoes, beans and pork products.  Turnips  are found in  pote de nabos  (turnip stew), a typical winter dish, just as  chestnuts  in the more humble  pote de castañes  (chestnut stew). Green beans, peas, potatoes, peppers, cawliflower and other vegetables are also common. Mushrooms from the Asturian forests are also found, such as  fairy ring mushrooms ,  oyster mushrooms ,  parasol mushrooms ...
 Among fruits,  apples  are most important (an indispensable element for making Asturian  cider , there being several autochthonous varieties). Cherries, strawberries and figs (such as  figos miguelinos ) are also quite typical, as well as chestnuts, walnuts and hazelnuts.
 
 Cheeses [ edit ] 
   Queso de Cabrales 
 Asturian cheeses, especially  Cabrales , are also famous throughout Spain and beyond; Cabrales is known for its pungent odour and strong flavour. Asturias is often called "the land of cheeses" ( el pais de los quesos ) due to the product's diversity and quality in this region. Other famous cheeses are:
 
 Afuega'l pitu 
 Quesu de los Beyos  [ ast ] 
 Casín cheese 
 Gamonéu cheese 
 La Peral cheese 
 Dishes [ edit ] 
 The most famous regional dish is  fabada Asturiana , a rich  stew  made with the Asturian typical large white  beans  ( fabes de la Granja ),  pork  shoulder ( llacón ),  morcilla ,  chorizo , and  saffron  ( azafrán ).
 Other major dishes include beans with  clams  ( fabes con almejas ), Asturian stew,  Cachopo ,  frixuelos , and  rice pudding .
 
   Asturian cider being poured in the traditional manner. 
 Beverages [ edit ] 
 Apple  groves foster the production of the traditional alcoholic drink, a natural  cider  ( sidra ).  It is a very dry cider, and unlike French or English natural ciders, uses predominantly acidic apples, rather than sweet or bittersweet. The proportions are: acidic 40%, sub-acidic 30-25%, sweet 10-15%, bittersweet 15-20%, bitter  5%. [1] 
 Sidra is traditionally poured in by an expert server (or  escanciador ): the bottle is raised high above his or her head to oxygenate the brew as it moves into the glass below. The glass is also held at a slight angle. A small amount (~120ml) is poured at a time (called a "culín"), as it must be drunk immediately before the sidra loses its carbonation.  Any sidra left in the glass is poured onto a woodchip-strewn floor or a trough along the bottom of the bar.
