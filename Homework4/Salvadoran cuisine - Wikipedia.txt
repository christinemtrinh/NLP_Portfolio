 Culinary traditions of El Salvador 
   Various Salvadoran dishes 
 Salvadoran cuisine  is a style of cooking derived from the nation of  El Salvador . The indigenous foods consist of a mix of  Native American cuisine  from groups such as the  Lenca ,  Pipil ,  Maya Poqomam ,  Maya Chʼortiʼ ,  Alaguilac ,  Mixe , and  Cacaopera  peoples. Many of the dishes are made with  maize  (corn). There is also heavy use of pork and seafood. Eurasian ingredients were incorporated after the  Spanish conquest .
 El Salvador's most notable dish is the  pupusa , a thick handmade  corn flour  or  rice flour  flatbread stuffed with  cheese ,  chicharrón  (cooked  pork  meat ground to a paste consistency),  refried beans  or  loroco  (a vine flower bud native to  Central America ). There are also vegetarian options, often with ayote (a type of squash) or garlic. Some restaurants even offer pupusas stuffed with shrimp or spinach which are served with  salsa roja , a cooked tomato sauce, often served with  curtido .  Pollo encebollado  is another popular Salvadoran dish that contains chicken simmered with onions. Salvadoran cheeses  queso duro  (hard cheese),  queso fresco  (fresh cheese), and  cuajada  are eaten with meals.
 Two other typical Salvadoran dishes are  yuca frita  and  panes rellenos .  Yuca frita  is deep-fried  cassava  root served with  curtido  (a pickled cabbage, onion and carrot topping) and chicharron with  pepesca  (fried baby sardines). The yuca is sometimes served boiled instead of fried.  Panes rellenos  ("stuffed bread") are warm  submarine sandwiches . The turkey or chicken is marinated and then roasted with Pipil spices and hand-pulled. This sandwich is traditionally served with  turkey  or  chicken ,  tomato , and  watercress  along with  cucumber  and  cabbage .
 Other well-known Salvadoran dishes include  carne guisada  (saucy beef with potatoes and carrots),  lomo entomatado  (beef with tomatoes),  carne asada  (grilled steak, usually served with a type of Salvadoran salsa called  chimol ),  pasteles de carne  (meat pies),  pollo guisado con hongos  (chicken with mushrooms),  pacaya planta  (palm flowers breaded in cornmeal, fried and served with tomato sauce),  pavo salvadoreño  (roast turkey with sauce, often eaten for Christmas),  ceviche  de camarones  (lime-cooked shrimp), and  pescado empanizado  (breaded, fried fish fillets). Salvadorean  chorizo  is short, fresh (not dried) and tied into twin sausages.

Minutas ,  shaved ice  flavored with fruit-flavored syrup, and  horchata , a beverage made from rice milk and a mix of spices such as cinnamon, peanut beverage,  ajonjolí  (sesame seeds) and  morro , are popular throughout the country and enjoyed on a hot day.

Other drinks include  arrayán ,  chuco  and  chilate . Another popular beverage is  ensalada  ("salad"), made of pineapple juice with finely chopped fruits, usually apples,  marañón , mamey, and watercress.

Vinagre de piña  is a drink of trimmed pineapples mixed with  panela  and water and set aside to ferment for a few weeks or even months.
