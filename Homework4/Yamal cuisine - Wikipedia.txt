   Dried reindeer meat 
 Traditional  Yamal cuisine  is  an important part of national culture of  Nenets ,  Khanty  and  Komi .  Yamal  is a  hunting  and  fishing  land so many dishes include meat,  fowl  and  fish .   Berries  and  mushrooms  are also abundant; this accounts for the wealth of "gifts of the forests" on the Yamal table. Presently, Yamal cuisine is renowned for diverse delicacies of  Russian cuisine . Yamal hosts enjoy treating their guests with traditional Yamal cuisine and have hot tea which came to Yamal cuisine from Russia. Tea has become the national Yamal  beverage , drunk to warm and soothe. Yamal is in northern Russia with frigid winters, so its cuisine should be nourishing to give the people energy to survive during the long  winter time. The essential component of Yamal cuisine is warm and hot dishes. Fresh  fruits  and  vegetables  are rarely used as they must be imported, as they are not grown in the  tundra . The Yamal cuisine is associated with  malosol  and  stroganina . Yamal cuisine has absorbed techniques from other regions. Yamal cuisine is based on  reindeer  meat and fish of the Yamal rivers, enriched with mushrooms and  bread .
 The most known dishes of Yamal cuisine are: 
Fish Soup made from  burbot ), Malosol, Bread on the Selkup, Stroganina (Sliced Fish), Chopsy Shomoh, Warka, Sliced meat, Preserves of vendace, Kulebyaka ( pie  with fish), Aibat-nyarhul (raw fish).
 
 
 Uha (fish soup) [ edit ] 
 Fish soup  mostly is served as the first course at dinner. Fish is cut up and cut into pieces and immersed in cold water. When boiling, the  cauldron  is moved aside to slow fire and skimmed when necessary.  It should be brewed to a bluish-gray color and served at once. Usually it is drunk with a mug.
 
 Malosol [ edit ] 
 Malosol comes from  Muksun . The key secret to this dish is cutting the fish into very delicate slices very fast in order that the fish remains slightly frozen. It is prepared from just caught muksun. Fish are gutted and cleaned, and liberally sprinkled with salt then held for 3-4 hours.
 
 Bread of Selkup [ edit ] 
 "Bread is head for everything" is a saying of Russians and  Selkups . It symbolizes hospitality of the house. Bread of Selkup is mentioned from the 8th-9th centuries. The bread is baked not in an oven as Russians do although the initial stages are the same.  Flour  is mixed with water and  salt . Soda is used instead of  yeast  to raise the dough and it is baked in very hot sand on the fire.
 
 Hot smoked fish [ edit ] 
 See also:  List of smoked foods 
 Yamal cuisine has four principal types of fish dishes: “as it is”, boiled, baked and smoked.  Smoked fish  is  very popular on the table nowadays. Hot smoked fish is prepared in the towns and villages, although it is not the national dish. Camp cooking uses an aluminum saucepan filled with smoldering sawdust, topped with a wire grid. A low heat is all that is needed to give the fish a golden hue, indicating doneness.
 
 Stroganina (sliced fish) [ edit ] 
 Stroganina   have always been a pride of Yamal. It is a delicacy and a simple food which is prepared from frozen white  salmon . Strips of skin are cut from the back and abdomen from tail to head. Vertical incisions are made in the flesh. The fish is placed head down on a hard surface and skinned. With sostragivaetsya, the fish is in thin slices or layers, depending on whether male or female fish are used.
