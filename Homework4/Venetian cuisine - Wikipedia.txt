 Venetian cuisine , from the city of  Venice ,  Italy [1] 
or more widely from the region of  Veneto , has a centuries-long history and differs significantly from other cuisines of  northern Italy  (notably  Friuli-Venezia Giulia  and  Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol ), and of neighbouring  Austria  and of  Slavic  countries (notably  Slovenia  and  Croatia ), despite sharing some commonalities.
 
   Food and drink have played an important role in Venetian culture for centuries. This image shows a 16th-century fresco in the  Villa Caldogno , where some noblemen and noblewomen enjoy  merenda , or a mid-afternoon snack, eating  bussoli , or typical sweets from  Vicenza . 
 
 Overview [ edit ] 
 Cuisine in Veneto may be divided into three main categories, based on geography: the coastal areas, the plains, and the mountains. Each one (especially the plains) can have many local cuisines, each city with its own dishes.
 The most common dish is  polenta , which is cooked in various ways within the local cuisines of Veneto. Polenta once was the universal  staple food  of the poorer classes, who could afford little else. In Veneto, the corns are ground in much smaller fragments in comparison with the rest of Italy: so, when cooked, it resembles a pudding.
 Typical of many coastal areas, communities along the coast of the  Laguna Veneta  serve mainly  seafood  dishes.
 In the plains it is very popular to serve grilled meat (often by a  barbecue , and in a mix of pork, beef and chicken meat) together with grilled polenta, potatoes or vegetables. Other popular dishes include  risotto , rice cooked with many different kinds of food, from vegetables, mushrooms, pumpkin or  radicchio   to seafood, pork meat or chicken livers.  Bigoli  (a typical Venetian fresh  pasta , similar to  Udon ),  fettuccine  (hand-made  noodles ),  ravioli  and the similar  tortelli  (filled with meat, cheese, vegetables or pumpkin) and  gnocchi  (potatoes-made fresh pasta), are fresh and often hand-made pasta dishes (made of eggs and  wheat flour ), served together with meat sauce ( ragù ) often made with duck meat, sometimes together with mushrooms or peas, or simply with melted butter. [2] 
 Cuisine from the mountain areas is mainly made of pork or  game  meat, with polenta, as well as mushrooms or cheeses (made by cow milk), and some dish from  Austrian  or  Tyrolese  tradition, such as  canederli  or  strudel . A typical dish is  casunziei , hand-made fresh pasta similar to  ravioli .
 Among the typical seasoning of Venetian cuisine, you can find  butter ,  olive oil ,  sunflower oil ,  vinegar ,  kren ,  senape ,  mostarda ,  salsa verde .
 The following are dishes typical of the three subregions of the Veneto. The page for  Venetian language  provides additional information on writing and pronouncing the dishes' names.
 
 Venice and the lagoon [ edit ] 
   Venetan liver, or  fegato alla veneziana  in Italian, served with  potatoes  and  polenta . 
   Sarde in saòr . 
 Bigołi in salsa : bigoli pasta served with an  anchovy  and  onion  sauce. 
 Fegato ała venesiana : a high-class Venetian plate of liver, chopped and cooked together with chopped onions. 
 Mołeche : fried  soft-shell crab  of the species ( Carcinus maenas ).  Mołeche  are very valuable because the process of molting in the brackish lagoons only lasts a few hours, after which the shell hardens and the crab is again called  maxenete . 
 Pasta e faxioi : bean soup with noodles (typically long pasta rough). 
 Połenta e schie : small shrimp from the lagoon (gray mud, gray-brown from boiled), fried and perched on a bed of very soft, white polenta. 
 Rixi e bixi : a poor but tasty dish consisting of a simple risotto with  pancetta  and peas cooked in a broth. 
 Rixoto de gò :  rice  prepared with  goby  (of the  Gobius ophiocephalus  species), also known as  gò , typical fish of the  Venetian Lagoon . 
 Sarde in saor : fried  sardines , dipped in partially fried  onion  in the same oil in which the sardines are fried, raisins and pine nuts (traditionally only by winter to increase the calories), other spices and sprinkled with plenty of vinegar. One leaves everything to marinate at least one night. 
 Sepe al nero : cuttlefish cooked with their ink lagoon. 
 Among the many Venetian desserts, the most well-known are:
 
 Baicołi  (or  baicoli ). 
 Fritołe  (or  frittelle ). 
 Pinza  (or  pinsa ): an  Epiphany  cake based on  cornmeal  and mixed  dried fruits  (usually  figs  and  raisins ) and  nuts . 
 Xałeti  (or  zaletti ): cornmeal  biscotti  with  raisins . 
 Verona [ edit ] 
   Pastissada de caval . 
   Tortellini di Valeggio . 
 Brasato  all'Amarone : braised beef meat cooked with  Amarone  wine, often served together with  polenta . 
 Gnocchi . It is tradition to eat homemade potato gnocchi on Venerdì Gnocolar, the last Friday of  Carnival . 
 Lesso e pearà .  Lesso  is the  bollito misto  popular across entire northern Italy, that in Verona is uniquely served with  pearà : a thick, slow cooking sauce made from the boiled meats'  stock , grated stale bread, ox  marrow  and abundant ground  black pepper . Some recipes also add  olive oil , grated  Parmigiano Reggiano  or  butter . The sauce's name comes from  pear , dialect for pepper; hence  pearà , "peppered". In the past this was a lavish meal for the majority of the populace and therefore served on major festivities like Christmas. 
 Pastissada de caval : an ancient horse meat  stew  dating back to the Middle-Age. It's prepared with  bay leaves ,  nutmeg ,  cloves , salt, pepper, vegetables, and beef stock and slow cooked until the meat melts; it's served with polenta. 
 Polenta e renga : polenta accompanied by typical oil preserved  herrings . Salted herrings ( renga ) are boiled or grilled, then cleaned, cut into pieces, and pickled in olive oil with  garlic ,  parsley  and  capers ; after 40 days of maturation, the herrings are ready to be served or put into jars for preservation. This dish originated in the Parona neighbourhood of Verona (and more broadly or the whole city) and is traditionally eaten on  Ash Wednesday . 
 Riso Vialone Nano : a rice variety typical of southern Veronese lowlands ( Bassa Veronese ). It lends itself best to the preparation of excellent  risottos , and used as such throughout Veneto and Italy. 
 Risotto all'Amarone : risotto with the local  Amarone  red wine. It is typical of the  Valpolicella  wine region. 
 Rixoto col tastasal : risotto made with the same seasoned ground pork used in  salame  and  sausages ; traditionally this dish was a mean of tasting the mix before making sausages (hence the name  tastasal , "to taste salt"). 
 Tortellini di Valeggio : hand-made fresh pasta of  tortellini  kind, stuffed with a mix of beef, pork meats and vegetables, usually served with melted butter and  sage . They are typical of the town of  Valeggio sul Mincio , southwest of Verona.

 Vicenza , along with Venice, has one of the most distinctive cuisines in the Veneto. Previously, the Vicentians were often referred to as the  magnagati  or  mangiagatti  (meaning " cat eaters ") due to the alleged presence of cats in their cuisine (caused from poverty in the past and during World War II), though the cooking of cats is now illegal in Italy.
