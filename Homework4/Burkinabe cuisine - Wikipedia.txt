 Burkinabé cuisine , the  cuisine  of  Burkina Faso , is similar to the cuisines in many parts of  West Africa , and is based on  staple foods  of  sorghum ,  millet ,  rice ,  fonio ,  maize ,  peanuts ,  potatoes ,  beans ,  yams  and  okra . [1]  Rice, maize and millet are the most commonly eaten grains. [2]  Grilled meat is common, particularly  mutton ,  goat ,  beef  and  fish . [3] 
 Vegetables include yams and potatoes, okra, tomatoes, zucchini, carrots, leeks, onions, beets, pumpkins, cucumbers, cabbage, sorrel and spinach. [2] 
 Although imported products are becoming more common in urban areas, meals in more rural areas typically consist of  Tô (Food) , a sauce of  corchorus  or  baobab  leaves, as well as the  calyx  from  Bombax costatum , dried fish, and spices such as chili and  soumbala . [4]
