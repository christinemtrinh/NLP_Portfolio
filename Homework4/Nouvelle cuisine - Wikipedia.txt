 Approach to food cooking and presentation 
   An example of  nouvelle cuisine  presentation 
 Nouvelle cuisine  ( French:  [nuvɛl kɥizin] ;  lit.   'new cuisine') is an approach to cooking and food presentation in  French cuisine . In contrast to  cuisine classique , an older form of  haute cuisine , nouvelle cuisine is characterized by lighter, more delicate dishes and an increased emphasis on  presentation . It was popularized in the 1960s by the food critic  Henri Gault , who invented the phrase, and his colleagues  André Gayot  and  Christian Millau  in a new restaurant guide, the  Gault-Millau , or  Le Nouveau Guide .
 
 
 History [ edit ] 
   Menon,  La nouvelle cuisine  (1742) 
 The term "nouvelle cuisine" has been used several times in the history of French cuisine, to mark a clean break with the past.
 In the 1730s and 1740s, several French writers emphasized their break with tradition, calling their cooking "modern" or "new".   Vincent La Chapelle  published his  Cuisinier moderne  in 1733–1735. The first volumes of  Menon 's  Nouveau traité de la cuisine  was published in 1739.  And it was in 1742 that Menon introduced the term  nouvelle cuisine  as the title of the third volume of his  Nouveau traité . [1]   François Marin  worked in the same tradition.
 In the 1880s and 1890s, the cooking of  Georges Auguste Escoffier  was sometimes described with the term. [2] 
 
   A  Jacques Lameloise  (a three-star  Michelin Guide  chef)  nouvelle cuisine  presentation 
 The modern usage is variously attributed to authors  Henri Gault ,  Christian Millau , and  André Gayot , [3] [4]  who used  nouvelle cuisine  to describe the cooking of  Paul Bocuse , [5]   Alain Chapel ,  Jean  and  Pierre Troisgros ,  Michel Guérard ,  Roger Vergé , and  Raymond Oliver , many of whom were once students of  Fernand Point . [6]  Paul Bocuse claimed that Gault first used the term to describe food prepared by Bocuse and other top chefs for the maiden flight of the  Concorde  airliner in 1969. [7] 
 The style Gault and Millau wrote about was a reaction to the French  cuisine classique  placed into "orthodoxy" by Escoffier.  Calling for greater simplicity and elegance in creating dishes,  nouvelle cuisine  is not  cuisine minceur  ("thin cooking"), which was created by Michel Guérard as spa food.  It has been speculated that the outbreak of  World War II  was a significant contributor to  nouvelle cuisine's  creation—the short supply of animal protein during the  German  occupation made it a natural development. [8] 
 
 The "formula" [ edit ]

 Gault and Millau discovered the "formula" contained in ten characteristics of this new style of cooking. The ten characteristics identified were: [9] 
 
 A rejection of excessive complication in cooking. 
 Cooking times for most fish, seafood, game birds, veal, green vegetables, and pâtés were greatly reduced in an attempt to preserve their natural flavours. Steaming was an important trend from this characteristic. 
 The cuisine was made with the freshest possible ingredients. 
 Large menus were abandoned in favour of shorter menus. 
 Strong marinades for meat and game ceased to be used. 
 Heavy sauces such as  espagnole  and  béchamel  were replaced by seasonings with fresh herbs, high-quality butter, lemon juice, and vinegar. 
 Regional dishes replaced  cuisine classique  as a source of inspiration. 
 New techniques were embraced and modern equipment was often used; Bocuse even used microwave ovens. 
 The chefs paid close attention to the dietary needs of their guests through their dishes. 
 The chefs were extremely inventive and created new combinations and pairings. [6] 
 Abandonment [ edit ] 
 There is a standing debate as to whether  nouvelle cuisine  has been abandoned. Much of what it stood for—particularly its preference for lightly presented, fresh flavours—has been assimilated into mainstream restaurant cooking. By the mid-1980s, some food writers stated that the style of cuisine had reached exhaustion and many chefs began returning to the cuisine classique style of cooking, although much of the lighter presentations and new techniques remained. [6]
