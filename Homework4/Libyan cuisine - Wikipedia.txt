 Culinary traditions of Libya 
   Libyan  asida  served with  rub  and molten sheep  ghee ; the traditional way to eat Libyan  asida  is to do so using the index and middle fingers of the right hand. 
   Location of  Libya 
 The  cuisine of  Libya  is  Arab  and  Mediterranean  with  Italian  influence. [1]  One of the most popular Libyan dishes is  bazin , an  unleavened bread  prepared with  barley , water and salt. [2]   Bazin  is prepared by boiling  barley flour  in water and then beating it to create a dough using a  magraf , which is a unique stick designed for this purpose. [3]   Pork  consumption is forbidden, in accordance with  Sharia , the religious laws of  Islam . [4] 
 In  Tripoli , Libya's capital, the cuisine is particularly influenced by  Italian cuisine . [4]   Pasta  is common, and many  seafood  dishes are available. [4]  Southern Libyan cuisine is more traditionally  Arab  with  Berber  influence. Common fruits and vegetables include  figs ,  dates ,  oranges ,  apricots  and  olives . [4]

 Bazin  is a common Libyan food made with  barley   flour  and a little plain flour, which is boiled in salted water to make a hard dough, and then formed into a rounded, smooth dome placed in the middle of the dish. The sauce around the dough is made by frying chopped onions with lamb meat, turmeric, salt, cayenne pepper, black pepper, fenugreek, sweet paprika, and tomato paste.  Potatoes  can also be added. Finally,  boiled eggs  are arranged around the dome. The dish is then served with  lemon  and fresh or pickled chili peppers, known as  amsyar .  Batata mubattana  (filled potato) is another popular dish that consists of fried potato pieces filled with spiced minced meat and covered with egg and breadcrumbs.
