 Annotations [ edit ] 
 
 
 ^    The  political status of Kosovo  is disputed. Having unilaterally declared independence from  Serbia  in 2008, Kosovo  is formally recognised as an independent state  by 101 out of 193 ( 52.3%) UN member states (with another 13 recognising it at some point but then withdrawing their recognition), while Serbia continues to claim it as part of its own territory.
