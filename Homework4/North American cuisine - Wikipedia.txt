 North American Cuisine  includes foods native to or popular in countries of  North America , such as  Canadian cuisine ,  American cuisine ,  African American cuisine ,  Mexican cuisine ,  Caribbean cuisine  and  Central American cuisine . North American cuisines display influence from many international cuisines, including  Native American cuisine ,  Jewish cuisine ,  African cuisine ,  Asian cuisine , and especially  European cuisine . [1] 
 
   Grilled Shrimp 
 As a broad, geo-culinary term, North American cuisine also includes  Central American  and  Caribbean  cuisines.  These regions are part of North America, so these regional cuisines also fall within the penumbra of North American cookery.
 
   Burrito 
 The term "regional" is somewhat ambiguous, however, since the cuisine of Puerto Rico can differ markedly from Cuban cuisine; Mexican cuisine spills across the border into the Tex-Mex and Mexi-Cali "sub-cuisines"; and the cuisines of Michigan and Ontario have more in common with each other than either has with the cuisines of Manitoba or Iowa.
 North American cuisine can also include dishes and cuisines that originated in North America such as the Canadian  poutine  and regional cuisines like  California cuisine .
