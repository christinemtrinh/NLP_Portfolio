 Culinary traditions of Malawi 
   Nshima  (top right corner) with three  relishes 
   Kachumbari 
 Malawian cuisine  includes the foods and culinary practices of  Malawi . Tea and fish are popular features of Malawian cuisine. [1]  Sugar, coffee, corn, potatoes, sorghum, cattle and goats are also important components of the cuisine and economy.
 Lake Malawi  is a source of fish including  chambo  (similar to  bream ),  usipa  (similar to  sardine ),  mpasa  (similar to  salmon ), and  kampango . [1] 
 Nsima  is a staple food made from ground corn and served with side dishes of meat, beans and vegetables. It can be eaten for lunch and dinner. [1] 
 Additional Malawi cuisine includes:
 
 Kachumbari , a type of tomato and onion  salad , known locally in Malawi as a  sumu  or  shum  or simply 'tomato and onion salad'. 
 Thobwa , a  fermented drink  made from white maize and millet or sorghum. 
 Kondowole , made from  cassava  flour and  water . [2] [3]  It is primarily from northern  Malawi  and is a very sticky meal resembling Malawian  nsima , Tanzanian  ugali , or Ugandan  posho . It is mostly cooked on the floor because of its texture as it is normally tough to run a cooking stick through hence much strength is needed.  Kondowole  is normally eaten with fish.

 Fish [ edit ] 
 Fish in Malawi ranges from  utaka , kapenta, kampango, bombe, Mlamba, Micheni, Butter fish (known as Batala)and  chambo  (a famous fish from  Lake Malawi ) among others.
 Kondowole  is not a meal that can be made in bulk because of its consistency and texture, therefore is not as frequently eaten as  nsima .
