 Culinary traditions of Uzbekistan 
   Plov  ( pilaf ) 
 Uzbek cuisine  shares the culinary traditions of peoples across Central Asia. [1]  There is a great deal of grain farming in Uzbekistan, so breads and  noodles  are of importance, and Uzbek cuisine has been characterized as "noodle-rich". [2]   Mutton  is a popular variety of meat due to the abundance of sheep in the country and it is a part of various Uzbek dishes.
 
 
 Description [ edit ] 
 Bread ( nan  or  non ) is a staple; it is baked in a  tandur , which is frequently a pot rather than the deep pit or oven of India and Afghanistan. Many varieties of rice are eaten. [3]  Potatoes were introduced by the Soviets, and some elder Uzbeks still refuse to eat them. [4] 
 The most popular meat is mutton. Beef is common, and goat is eaten only rarely. Horse meat is used as well; there are sausages made of horse meat, as is the case with many other Turkic peoples. [3]   Karakul sheep  provide meat [5]  but also fat, particularly the fat from the tail end, called  qurdiuq . [3] 
 Uzbekistan's signature dish is  palov  ( plov  or osh or palov, "pilaf"), a main course typically made with  rice , pieces of  meat , grated  carrots  and  onions . It is usually cooked in a  kazan  (or  deghi ) over an open fire;  chickpeas ,  raisins ,  barberries , or fruit may be added for variation. Although often prepared at home for family and guests by the head of household or the housewife, palov is made on special occasions by the  oshpaz , or the  osh  master chef, who cooks the national dish over an open flame, sometimes serving up to 1,000 people from a single cauldron on holidays or occasions such as weddings.  Nahor oshi , or "morning plov", is served in the early morning (between 6 and 9 am) to large gatherings of guests, typically as part of an ongoing wedding celebration.
 Other notable national dishes include  shurpa  ( shurva  or  shorva ), a  soup  made of large pieces of fatty meat (usually mutton) and fresh vegetables;  norin  and  lagman , noodle-based dishes that may be served as a soup or a main course;  manti  (also called  qasqoni ),  chuchvara , and  somsa , stuffed pockets of dough served as an appetizer or a main course (ranging from "wonderfully flaky and rich" to "heavy, stodgy" [3] );  dimlama  (a meat and vegetable stew) and various  kebabs , usually served as a main course.
 Green tea  is the national hot beverage taken throughout the day;  teahouses  ( chaikhanas ) are of cultural importance.  Black tea  is preferred in Tashkent. Both are typically taken without  milk  or  sugar . Tea always accompanies a meal, but it is also a drink of hospitality, automatically offered green or black to every guest.  Ayran , a chilled yogurt drink, is popular in the summer.
 The use of alcohol is less widespread than in the West. Uzbekistan has 14  wineries , the oldest and most famous being the Khovrenko Winery in  Samarkand  (est. 1927). The Samarkand Winery produces a range of dessert wines from local  grape  varieties: Gulyakandoz, Shirin, Aleatiko, and Kabernet likernoe (literally  Cabernet  dessert wine in  Russian ). [6] [7]  Uzbek wines have received international awards and are exported to  Russia  and other countries in  Central Asia .
 The choice of desserts in Uzbek cuisines is limited. A typical festive meal ends with  fruit  or a compote of fresh or  dried fruit , followed by  nuts  and  halvah  with green tea.
 
 Bukharan Jewish cuisine [ edit ] 
 The cooking of  Bukharan Jews  forms a distinct cuisine within Uzbekistan, subject to the restrictions of  Jewish dietary laws . [8]  The most typical Bukharan Jewish dish is  oshi sabo  (also  osh savo  or  osovoh ), a "meal in a pot" slowly cooked overnight and eaten hot for  Shabbat  lunch. Oshi sabo is made with meat, rice, vegetables, and fruit added for a unique sweet and sour taste. [9]   By virtue of its culinary function (a hot Shabbat meal in Jewish homes) and ingredients (rice, meat, vegetables cooked together overnight), oshi sabo is a Bukharan version of  cholent  or  hamin .
 In addition to  oshi sabo , authentic Bukharian Jewish dishes include: [10] 
 
 Osh palov  - a Bukharian Jewish version of  palov  for weekdays, includes both beef and  chicken . 
 Bakhsh  - "green palov", rice with meat or chicken and green herbs ( coriander ,  parsley ,  dill ), exists in two varieties; bakhshi  khaltagi  cooked Jewish-style in a small bag immersed in a pot with boiling water or soup and bakhshi  degi  cooked like regular palov in a cauldron; [11]  bakhshi  khaltagi  is precooked and therefore can be served on  Shabbat . 
 Khalta savo  - food cooked in a bag (usually rice and meat, possibly with the addition of dried fruit). [8] [12] 
 Yakhni  - a dish consisting of two kinds of boiled meat (beef and chicken), brought whole to the table and sliced before serving with a little broth and a garnish of boiled vegetables; a main course for  Friday night dinner . [8] 
 Kov roghan  - fried pieces of chicken with fried potatoes piled on top. [13] 
 Serkaniz  ( Sirkoniz ) - garlic rice dish, another variation of  palov . [ citation needed ] 
 Oshi piyozi  - stuffed onion. [11] 
 Shulah  - a Bukharian-style  risotto . 
 Boyjon  - eggplant puree mixed only with salt and garlic, the traditional starter for the Friday-night meal in Bukharan Jewish homes. [8] 
 Slotah Bukhori  - a salad made with tomato, cucumber, green onion, cilantro, salt, pepper, and lemon juice. Some also put in lettuce and chili pepper. 
 Noni Toki  - a crispy flat bread that is baked on the back of a wok. This method creates a bowl shaped bread. 
 Fried fish with garlic sauce (for  Friday night dinner ): [11]  "Every Bukharian Sabbath ... is greeted with a dish of fried fish covered with a pounded sauce of garlic and cilantro." [14]  In the Bukharan dialect, the dish is called  mai birion  or in full  mai birion ovi sir , where  mai birion  is fried fish and  ovi sir  is garlic sauce (literally "garlic water"). [8]  Bread is sometimes fried and then dipped in the remaining garlic water and is called  noni-sir . 
 Uzbek dishes [ edit ]

 Palov [ edit ] 
 Palov was not available to the general population until the 1930s, the Soviet era. Traditionally only men cooked the dish, but when the Soviets took over control of the country, they liberated women, who were then also allowed to prepare it. Since then, however, according to food scholar Nancy Rosenberger (writing in 2012), "the pendulum was swinging back, if it had ever swung very far".
 The basis is meat, usually mutton, with vegetables (carrots and onions), fried in  qurdiuq  (fat from the sheep's tail end). The mixture of onion and thinly cut carrot is called  zirvak , and it is compared to European  soffrito . Often garbanzos and raisins are added, and instead of mutton all kinds of other basic ingredients can be used, including stuffed grape leaves or poultry.
 The meat is either boiled or fried with the  zirvak . The rice is cooked by being soaked and then placed on top of the other ingredients, so it steams--in contrast to other popular ways of making pilaf, where rice is fried, and the other ingredients added, and then the entire dish being cooked in water. [3] 
 
 Oshi toki  - stuffed grape leaves, similar to  dolma , usually served as a cold appetizer. 
 Breads [ edit ] 
   Bread baking in  Samarkand 
   Patyr 
 Traditional Uzbek bread, called generically  noni [15]  or  patyr , is baked in the form of circular flat loaves ( lepyoshka  in Russian) with a thin decorated depression at the center and a thicker rim all around. Nons are brought to the table with the decorated side up, then torn into irregular chunks which are stacked on the bread plate. Every region has different varieties of non, most prominent are:
 
 Obi non  is the staple bread of Uzbek cuisine. Obi nons are mentioned in one of the oldest written works, the  Epic of Gilgamesh . Obi nons are baked in clay ovens called  tandir . 
 Samarkand non . In different areas of Uzbekistan, obi non is baked in different ways. In Samarkand, small thick obi nons, the shirma nons are the most popular. 
 Bukhara obi non  sprinkled with  sesame  or nigella, making a delicate aroma. 
 Wedding patir  (flaky obi non) from Andijon and Qashqadaryo. According to ancient traditions, this aromatic bread prepared with cream and butter was served during matchmaking meetings. 
 Tashkent lochira , plate-formed obi non, baked from short pastry (milk, butter, and sugar). Jirish non is specially prepared bread from flour mixed with  wheat . Nomadic tribes did not make tandirs because of their way of living, but cooked bread on butter in kazans (cauldrons), preparing the dough on a milk base.
