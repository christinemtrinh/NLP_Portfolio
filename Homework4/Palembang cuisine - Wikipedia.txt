 Palembangese cuisine  is the cuisine of the  Palembangese people  of the city of  Palembang  in the  South Sumatra  province of  Indonesia . [1]  It is the second most well-known cuisine from  Sumatra  after  Padang .
 
 
 Ingredients [ edit ] 
   Floating  warung  boat attached to the bank of  Musi river ,  Palembang , selling local favourite such as  pempek . Palembang cuisine rely extensively on Musi's freshwater fisheries. 
 Palembang cuisine primarily uses  freshwater fish  and  prawns  as key ingredients due to the paramount role of the  Musi River  for the area. Popular freshwater fish includes  patin  ( Pangasius ),  baung  ( Hemibagrus ),  lais  ( Kryptopterus cryptopterus ),  lele  ( catfish ),  gabus  ( snakehead ),  mas  ( carp ) and  gurame  ( gourami ). Historically, Palembang waters were teeming with  belido  ( giant featherback ), and it has become the city's official animal mascot. It is valued for its succulent flavour and soft texture. However, due to  overfishing , today the  belido  fish are scarce and probably already extinct in Musi river area. [2] 
 Because of its location that is not far from the sea, seafood such as shrimp,  tenggiri  ( wahoo ),  kakap merah  ( red snapper ) and  Spanish mackerel  are also popular in Palembang.
 Besides freshwater fish dishes, there are many variations of dishes, snacks, drinks, and sweets in Palembang cuisine. [ citation needed ] 
 
 Spices and flavouring [ edit ] 
   Tempoyak patin , pangasius fish served in fermented durian sauce. 
 Spices are also generally included although not as liberally as its same-island counterpart. Palembang cuisine is noted by its preference to the sour and sweet flavour, [3]  as evidences in  pindang  fish soup, funky-smelled  tempoyak -based dish made from fermented  durian , and also  kuah cuko  spicy sweet vinegar sauce of  pempek  fishcake. Those dishes are popular fare and often associated with the city. [4] 
 
 Influences [ edit ] 
   Pindang patin . 
 Malay ,  Javanese ,  Arab ,  Indian  and  Chinese  culture has influenced Palembang's culinary scene.
 Pempek, tekwan and mie celor are the example of Chinese cuisine influence on Palembang. Pempek is basically fishcake made from deboned fish flesh and tapioca flour, which was a local adaptation of East Asian  surimi  fishcake making. While like most of noodle dishes of Indonesia, mie celor can trace its origin back to Chinese influences.
 It was popularly believed that Palembang preference of sweet flavour was due to Javanese influences that favouring palm sugar. Indeed, Palembang absorb many  Javanese  elements, including language and cuisine. For example, both  Javanese  and  Palembang Malay  dialects refer fish as  iwak , and  cooking method employing banana leaf package  as  brengkes  or  brengkesan . [3] 
 Martabak Palembang and nasi minyak which uses ghee, on the other hand, demonstrate Indian cuisine influence in the city.
 
 Dishes [ edit ] 
   Pempek kapal selam  and  pempek kriting , simmered with spicy  cuko  sauce. 
   From left to right clockwise:  lakso ,  burgo , and  laksan . 
 Palembang dishes are well known for its extensive use of freshwater fish, its practice of making  surimi -like fishcakes as the base of various recipes, also the use of  palm sugar ,  coconut milk ,  vinegar  or  tamarind  as flavouring agent. Examples of Palembang's favourite are: [1] 
 
 Pempek , is the dish virtually everyone in Indonesia thinks of when mentioning Palembang cuisine. It is a dough of fish cake and  tapioca flour  which can be either boiled, fried, or grilled and is eaten with a dark, sweet and spicy sauce called  Cuko  made from  palm sugar  and  pepper  topped with cucumber and prawn powder. Because it is actually a dough, locals have intelligently crafted them into shapes and sizes, as well as being creative with fillings. Examples include  lenjer  (long),  keriting  (curly),  kapal selam  (literally "submarine", filled with egg),  ada`an  (round and fried) and  pistel  (filled with cooked young papaya). Not every fish can be made into authentic Palembang pempek. A real authentic Palembang pempek is made of  giant featherback  ( Chitala lopis)  as its main ingredients. However, since the species is threatened, an authentic pempek can also be made with several other fish such as  striped snakehead  ( Channa striata ),  narrow-barred Spanish mackerel  ( Scomberomorus commerson ), or  snappers  ( Lutjanus sp. ). [5]   Tekwan soup
