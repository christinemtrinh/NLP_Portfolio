 Bangladeshi cuisine (Bengali: বাংলাদেশের রান্না) is the national cuisine of Bangladesh. Bangladeshi cuisine has been shaped by the diverse history and river-line geography of Bangladesh. The country has a tropical monsoon climate. The staple of Bangladesh is rice and fish.[1] The majority of Bangladeshi people are ethnic Bengali, who follow Bengali cuisine, with a minority of non-Bengalis with their own unique cuisine.[2][3][4] Bangladeshi food has more meat, especially beef, compared to West Bengal.[5][6]
 Bangladeshi cuisine has over time been largely influenced by the Mughlai cuisine left behind by the Mughal rulers. This has led Bangladeshi cuisine to include many rich aromatic dishes such as biriyani and korma that require the use of a large array of spices along with an great deal of ghee. Dhaka being the Mughal capital of the Bengal Subah (which includes the modern Bangladesh and the Indian states of West Bengal) was a major trading center in South Asia, so many culinary styles from around the world influenced the city's cuisine. After Dhaka became the capital of East Bengal, the Bangladeshi populace began to adopt the cuisine of the city with many unknown Persian, Turkish and Arabic-influenced dishes becoming popular.[7]
 The food used to be spiced with black pepper and chui jhal before the arrival of green chili from the Americas.[8]

Due to the high costs of producing Mughlai food, the recipes were limited to the elite classes in colonial India, and slowly expanded as Bangladesh's economy grew.

Such dishes as kebab; stuffed breads; kacchi biriyani; roast lamb, duck, and chicken; patisapta; Kashmiri tea; and korma are still served at special occasions like Eid and weddings.[11][12] Due to the high class of the food, using an excess amount of expensive ingredients like ghee, and making the food melt in one's mouth were essential to the feel of the food.[13]
