 Goan cuisine  consists of regional foods popular in  Goa , an Indian state located along  India 's west coast on the shore of the  Arabian Sea . Rice, seafood, coconut, vegetables, meat, bread, pork and local spices are some of the main ingredients in Goan cuisine. Use of  kokum  and  vinegar  is another distinct feature. Goan food is considered incomplete without  fish .
 The cuisine of Goa originated from its  Konkani  roots, and was influenced by the 451 years of  Portuguese rule  and the Sultanate rule that preceded the Portuguese. [1]  Many  Catholic  dishes are either similar to or variants of their  Portuguese  counterparts in both naming or their use of ingredients.

   Goan prawn curry, a popular dish throughout the state. 
 The cuisine of Goan people is mostly seafood-based; the  staple foods  are rice and fish.  Kingfish  ( vison  or  visvan ) is one of the most commonly eaten varieties of fish. Other fish varieties include  pomfret ,  shark ,  tuna ,  sardines , and  mackerel . Among the  shellfish  are  crabs ,  prawns ,  tiger prawns ,  lobster ,  squid , and  mussels . The food of Goan  Christians  is heavily influenced by the Portuguese. The use of vinegar, for example, is very prominent, specifically toddy vinegar, which is made from coconut sap that is retrieved from stems, and is then left to  ferment  for  four  to  six  months. [2] 
 
 Introduction of new foods [ edit ] 
 The Portuguese introduced potatoes, tomatoes, pineapples,  guavas , and  cashews  from  Brazil  to Goa and consequently India. The  chili pepper  is the most important aspect of Goan cuisine; it was introduced by the Portuguese and became immensely popular as a very important spice for wider Indian cuisine. One of Goa's national dishes is called  sorpotel , which is made from pork.

 Arroz doce  – A Portuguese sweetened rice custard 
 Balchão  – A curry made with prawns/shrimp
