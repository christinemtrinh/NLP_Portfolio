   Arroz con pollo  (rice with chicken) 
 Cuban cuisine  is largely based on  Spanish cuisine  with influence from African and other  Caribbean cuisines . Some Cuban recipes share spices and techniques with Spanish, African and Taino cooking, with some Caribbean influence in spice and flavor. This results in a blend of the several different cultural influences. A small but noteworthy Chinese influence can also be accounted for, mainly in the Havana area. There is also some Italian influence. During colonial times, Cuba was an important port for trade, and the Spanish ancestors of Cubans brought with them the culinary traditions of different parts of Spain. [1] 
 
 
 Overview [ edit ] 
 As a result of the  colonization  of  Cuba  by  Spain , one of the main influences on the cuisine is from Spain. [2]  Other culinary influences include the  Taíno , the indigenous people of Cuba, Africa, from the Africans who were brought to Cuba as  slaves , and French, from the French colonists who came to Cuba from  Haiti . [3]  Another factor is that Cuba is an island, making seafood something that greatly influences Cuban cuisine. Another contributing factor to Cuban cuisine is that Cuba is in a  tropical climate , which produces fruits and root vegetables that are used in Cuban dishes and meals. [4] 
 A typical meal consists of  rice and beans , cooked together or apart. When cooked together the recipe is called "congri" or "Moros" or " Moros y Cristianos " (black beans and rice). If cooked separately it is called "arroz con frijoles" (rice with beans) or "arroz y frijoles" (rice and beans). [5] 
 
 Cuban sandwich [ edit ] 
   A typical  Cuban sandwich  (picture from  South Florida ) 
 A  Cuban sandwich  (sometimes called a  mixto , especially in Cuba [6] [7] ) is a popular lunch item that grew out of the once-open flow of cigar workers between Cuba and Florida (specifically  Key West  and the  Ybor City  neighborhood of  Tampa ) in the late 19th century and has since spread to other  Cuban American  communities. [8] [9] [10] 
 The sandwich is built on a base of lightly buttered  Cuban bread  and contains sliced roast  pork , thinly sliced  Serrano ham ,  Swiss cheese ,  dill pickles , and  yellow mustard . In Tampa,  Genoa salami [11]  is traditionally layered in with the other meats, probably due to influence of  Italian   immigrants  who lived side by side with Cubans and Spaniards in Ybor City. [12]   Tomatoes  and  lettuce  are available additions in many restaurants, but these are considered by traditionalists as an unacceptable Americanization of the sandwich. [6] [13] 
 After assembly, the Cuban sandwich may be pressed in a grooveless panini-type grill called a  plancha , which both heats and compresses the contents. [6]
