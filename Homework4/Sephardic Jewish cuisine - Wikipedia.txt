 Assortment of cooking traditions of Sephardic Jews 
 See also:  Jewish cuisine ,  Mizrahi Jewish cuisine , and  Israeli cuisine 
   Western Sephardi  dish of  pescado frito , the predecessor of  fish and chips , introduced in the 17th century by Jews from Spain and Portugal, and now also a staple of  British cuisine 
   Boyoz  pastry, a regional specialty of  Izmir ,  Turkey  introduced to  Ottoman cuisine  by the Sephardim [1] 
 Sephardic Jewish cuisine  is an assortment of cooking traditions that developed among the  Sephardi Jews . 
 Those of this  Iberian  origin who were dispersed in the Sephardic Diaspora ultimately became the  Eastern Sephardim  and  North African Sephardim  as they settled throughout the  Mediterranean  in  Turkey ,  Greece , the  Balkans , and the  Arab countries  of  West Asia  and  North Africa . [2] 
 Cuisine of the Sephardi Jews also includes the cuisine of those who became the  Western Sephardim  who settled in  Holland ,  England , and from these places elsewhere.
 Mizrahi Jews , being the pre-existing Jews of the  Greater Middle East  (of non-Spanish and non-Portuguese origin), are sometimes called Sephardim in a broader sense due to their style of liturgy. Although there is some overlap in populations due to the Sephardic Diaspora, Sephardic Jews also settled in many other countries outside the Greater Middle East as well.
 As such, this article deals only with the cuisine of the Jewish populations with ancestral origins in the  Iberian Peninsula , in whichever regions they settled, not just the Greater Middle East. For  Cuisine of the Mizrahi Jews , please see that article.
 As with other  Jewish ethnic divisions  composing the Jewish Diaspora,  Sephardim  cooked foods that were popular in their countries of residence, adapting them to Jewish religious dietary requirements,  kashrut . Their choice of foods was also determined by economic factors, with many of the dishes based on inexpensive and readily available ingredients.
 Animals deemed permissible as a source of meat had to be slaughtered in keeping with  shechita , or Jewish ritual slaughter, which requires soaking and salting to remove blood. Hence, meat was often reserved for holidays and special occasions. Many Sephardi dishes use  ground meat . Milk and meat products could not be mixed or served at the same meal. 
 Cooked, stuffed and baked vegetables are central to the cuisine, as are various kinds of beans, chickpeas, lentils, and bulgur/burghul (cracked wheat). Rice takes the place of potatoes.
 
 
 History [ edit ] 
   Couscous  with vegetables and chickpeas 
 Sephardi Jews are the Jews of Spain, who were expelled or forced to convert to Christianity in 1492. Many of those expelled settled in North-African Berber and Arabic-speaking countries, such as Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria and Libya, becoming the North African Sephardim. Those who settled in Greece, Turkey, the Balkans, Syria, the Lebanon and the Holy Land became the Eastern Sephardim. 
 The Western Sephardim, also known more ambiguously as the  Spanish and Portuguese Jews , left Spain and Portugal as  New Christians  in a steady stream over the next few centuries, and converted back to  Judaism  once in Holland, England, etc. [ citation needed ] 
 While the pre-existing Jews of the countries in which they settled (in the Greater Middle East, for example, are called  Mizrahim ) are distinct, the term Sephardi as used in "Sephardi cuisine" would refer only to the culinary traditions of those Jews with ancestral origins to the Jews of Spain and Portugal. [ citation needed ] 
 
   Moroccan-style pickled lemons 
 Both the Jews of the Iberian Peninsula and the pre-existing Jews of  Morocco ,  Tunisia ,  Algeria ,  Bulgaria ,  Turkey ,  Syria ,  Egypt ,  Italy , and  Greece  into whose communities they settled adapted local dishes to the constraints of the  kosher  kitchen. 
 Since the establishment of a Jewish state and the convergence of Jews from all the globe in Israel, these local cuisines, with all their differences, have come to represent the collection of culinary traditions broadly known as Sephardi cuisine. [ citation needed ] 
 Some of the Jews who fled from the Inquisition with other Sephardim in the 15th century settled in  Recife, Brazil , where their cuisine was influenced by new local ingredients like molasses, rum, sugar, vanilla, chocolate, bell peppers, corn, tomatoes, kidney beans, string beans and turkey. 
 In 1654, 23 Sephardic Jews arrived in  New Amsterdam  (present-day New York) bringing this cuisine with them to the early colonial United States. Early American Jewish cuisine was heavily influenced by this branch of Sephardic cuisine. 
 Many of the recipes were bound up in observance of traditional holidays and remained true to their origins. These included dishes such as stew and fish fried in olive oil, beef and bean stews,  almond puddings , and  egg custards . The first  kosher  cookbook in America was the  Jewish Cookery Book  by Esther Levy which was published in 1871 in  Philadelphia  and includes many of the traditional recipes. [3] 
 
 Cuisine basics [ edit ] 
   Rice-stuffed peppers 
 Sephardi cuisine emphasizes salads, stuffed vegetables and vine leaves, olive oil, lentils, fresh and dried fruits, herbs and nuts, and chickpeas. Meat dishes often make use of lamb or ground beef. 
 Fresh lemon juice is added to many soups and sauces. Many meat and rice dishes incorporate dried fruits such as apricots, prunes and raisins. Pine nuts are used as a garnish.
 
 Herbs and spices [ edit ] 
 In the early days, Sephardic cuisine was influenced by the local cuisines of Spain and Portugal, both under Catholic and Islamic regimes. A particular affinity to exotic foods from outside of Spain became apparent under Muslim rule, as evidenced even today with ingredients brought in by the Muslims. [4] 
 Cumin ,  cilantro , and  turmeric  are very common in Sephardi cooking. Caraway and capers were brought to Spain by the Muslims and are featured in the cuisine. [4]   Cardamom  ( hel ) is used to flavor coffee. Chopped fresh cilantro and parsley are popular garnishes. Chopped mint is added to salads and cooked dishes, and fresh mint leaves ( nana ) are served in tea.  Cinnamon  is sometimes used as a meat seasoning, especially in dishes made with ground meat.  Saffron , which is grown in Spain, is used in many varieties of Sephardic cooking, as well as spices found in the areas where they have settled.
 
 Desserts and beverages [ edit ] 
   Date-filled  ma'amoul 
 Tiny cups of  Turkish coffee , sometimes spiced with cardamom, are often served at the end of a festive meal, accompanied by small portions of  baklava  or other pastries dipped in syrup or honey. Hot  sahlab , a liquidy cornstarch pudding originally flavored with orchid powder (today invariably replaced by artificial flavorings), is served in cups as a winter drink, garnished with cinnamon, nuts, coconut and raisins.  Arak   is the preferred alcoholic beverage.  Rose water  is a common ingredient in cakes and desserts.  Malabi , a cold cornstarch pudding, is sprinkled with rose water and red syrup.
 
 Pickles and condiments [ edit ] 
 Olives and pickled vegetables, such as cucumbers, carrots, cabbage and cauliflower, are a standard accompaniment to meals.  Amba  is a pickled mango sauce. Small  pickled lemons  are a Tunisian and Moroccan delicacy.
 
 Shabbat and holiday dishes [ edit ] 
 Shabbat [ edit ] 
   Potato burekas at  Mahane Yehuda Market ,  Jerusalem 
 On  Shabbat , the Jews of North Africa in Tunisia and Morocco serve  chreime , fish in a spicy tomato sauce.
 As cooking on Shabbat is prohibited, Sephardi Jews, like their Ashkenazi counterparts, developed slow-cooked foods that would simmer on a low flame overnight and be ready for eating the next day. 
 One slow-cooked food was  ropa vieja . The oldest name of the dish is  chamin  (from the Hebrew word "cham," which means "hot"), but there are several other names. [5]  When the Sephardic Jews were expelled from Spain in 1492, many fled to northwestern Africa across the Straits of Gibraltar. The  hamin  was changed, adjusting for local ingredients and then called  dafina  ("covered") in Morocco. Any favorite vegetables can be added, and the eggs can be removed and eaten at any time. Its Ashkenazi counterpart is called  shalet  or  cholent . 
 Shavfka  is another Sephardi dish that has an Ashkenazi counterpart, namely  kugel .  Bourekas  are often served on Shabbat morning.  Pestelas , sesame-seed topped pastry filled with pine nuts, meat and onion, are also traditional. [6] 
 Sambusak  is a semicircular pocket of dough filled with mashed chickpeas, fried onions and spices associated with Sephardic Jewish cuisine. [7]  According to Gil Marks, an Israeli food historian,  sambusak  has been a traditional part of the Sephardic  Sabbath  meal since the 13th century. [8] 
 
 Passover [ edit ] 
   Charoset 
 Sephardi and Ashkenazi cooking differs substantially on  Passover  due to rabbinic rulings that allow the consumption of  kitniyot , a category which is forbidden to Ashkenazi Jews. Sephardi Jews prepare  charoset , one of the symbolic foods eaten at the Passover  seder , from different ingredients. Whereas  charoset  in Ashkenazi homes is a blend of chopped apples and nuts spiced with wine and cinnamon, Sephardi  charoset  is based on raisins or dates and is generally much thicker in consistency.
 Mina  (known as  scacchi  in Italy) is a Passover meat or vegetable pie made with a  matzo  crust.
 
 Rosh Hashana [ edit ] 
   Libyan Jewish fruit preserves for Rosh Hashana 
 At the beginning of the evening meals of  Rosh Hashana , it is traditional to eat foods symbolic of a good year and to recite a short prayer beginning with the Hebrew words  yehi ratson  ("May it be Your will") over each one, with the name of the food in Hebrew or Aramaic often presenting a play on words. The foods eaten at this time have thus become known as  yehi ratsones . 
 Typical foods, often served on a large platter called a  yehi ratson  platter, include:
 
 Apples dipped in honey, or baked or sometimes in the form of a compote called  mansanada 
 Dates 
 Pomegranates, or black-eyed peas 
 Pumpkin, in the form of savory pumpkin-filled pastries called  rodanchas 
 Leeks, in the form of fritters called  keftedes de prasa 
 Beets, usually peeled and baked 
 Head of a fish, usually a fish course with a whole fish, head intact 
 It is also common to symbolize a year filled with blessings by eating foods with stuffing on Rosh Hashana such as a stuffed, roasted bird or a variety of stuffed vegetables called  legumbres yaprakes . [9] 
 
 Yom Kippur [ edit ] 
   Faloodeh 
 Customs for the first food eaten after the  Yom Kippur  fast differ. Iranian Jews often eat a mixture of shredded apples mixed with rose water called  faloodeh seeb .  Syrian  and  Iraqi Jews  eat round sesame crackers that look like mini- bagels .  Turkish  and  Greek Jews  sip a sweet drink made from  melon  seeds. [10] 
 
 Hanukkah [ edit ] 
 Sephardic  Hanukkah  dishes include  cassola  (sweet cheese pancakes),  buñuelos  (puffed fritters with an orange glaze),  keftes  de espinaka  (spinach patties),  keftes de prasa  (leek patties) and  shamlias  (fried pastry frills).
