   Dried  dates . 
 The  cuisine of Bahrain  consists of dishes such as  biryani ,  harees ,  khabeesa ,  machboos ,  mahyawa ,  maglooba ,  quzi  and  zalabia .  Arabic coffee  ( qahwah ) is the national beverage.
 Bahrain  is a small  island  state near the western shores of the  Persian Gulf . Much of the cuisine of Bahrain is a mixture of Arabic, Persian, Indian, Balochi, African, Far East and European food due to the influence of the various communities present, as Bahrain was an important seaport and trading junction since ancient times.

 Bahrain produces only a small amount of its food requirements due to limited land space and imports much of its food. [2]
