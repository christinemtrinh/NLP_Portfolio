 Culinary traditions of Mauritania 
   Camel couscous, made under the tent in the dunes of Ajouer (Mauritania) 
   Location of  Mauritania 
 The  cuisine of Mauritania  includes the culinary practices of  Mauritania . Historically, what is now Mauritania has been influenced by  Arab ,  Berbers  and  African  peoples who have lived in and traversed the "stark" landscape marked with  Sahara desert  dunes in  caravans . [1]  There is an overlap with  Moroccan cuisine  in the north and  Senegalese cuisine  in the south. [1] 
 French colonial influence (Mauritania was  a colony  until 1960) has also played a role in influencing the cuisine of the relatively isolated land. [1]   Alcohol  is  prohibited in the Muslim faith  and its sale is largely limited to hotels. [2] [1]   Mint tea  is widely consumed [1]  and poured from height to create foam. [3]  Traditionally, meals are eaten communally. [3]
