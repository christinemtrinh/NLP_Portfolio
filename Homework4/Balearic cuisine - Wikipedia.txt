 Balearic cuisine  is a  Mediterranean cuisine  as cooked in the  Balearic Islands ,  Spain . It can be regarded as part of a wider  Catalan cuisine , since it shares many dishes and ingredients with  Catalonia  and the  Valencian Community . Others view it as part of a more global  Spanish cuisine . Traditional Balearic cuisine is rich in  vegetables ,  cereal  and  legumes  as well as being low in  fats . A succinct selection of the primary dishes would be  ensaimades ,  seafood  and  vegetable   stews ,  sobrassada ,  coques ,  tombet ,  Maó cheese  and  wine .
 
   "Ensaïmades", a typical Majorcan pastry 
 
 Bakery and confectionery [ edit ] 
   Crespells 
 Unsalted  bread 
 Ensaïmada : Lard- based pastry sprinkled with powdered sugar. 
 Flaó :  Cottage cheese   tart . The recipe includes  eggs , cottage cheese,  sugar  and  mint . The mixture of  savoury  and  sweet   flavourings  may reflect  Arab  influence from the  Islamic  past of the islands. 
 Coca : Similar to  Italian pizza  but without cheese. Typically,  Majorcan  varieties include  julivert  ( parsley ),  pebres torrats  ( roasted   peppers ), and  trempó  ( tomato ,  green pepper  and  onion   salad ). 
 Easter   baking  products
 Panades :  lamb  and  pea  pasties. 
 Robiol :  cottage cheese - or  jam - stuffed   pastry 
 Crespell  [ es ]  is a Majorcan kind of biscuit. 
 Vegetables [ edit ] 
   Coca de trempó  [ es ] , typical in summer in the Balearic Islands 
 Traditional vegetables dishes are:
 
 Tombet : Fried  courgettes ,  potatoes ,  eggplant  and  red peppers   baked  in  tomato sauce , related to similar Mediterranean dishes such as  samfaina  or  ratatouille . 
 Fava parada  [ ca ] :  Fava bean  and mixed vegetable  puree 
 Trempó  [ es ] : made of pepper, onion and tomato; eat with mussels, in  coques , as a salad, etc.

 Fats [ edit ] 
 Olive oil  is the most commonly used fat in Balearic cooking.  Butter  is used sparingly, even in dishes frequently relying upon butter in other parts of the world, e.g.,  ous ferrats  ( fried eggs ) 
 Mayonnaise  is called  all i oli , 'garlic and oil' in Catalan. Some historians argue that  mayonnaise  originates from  Mahon  (known in Catalan as Maó), the capital of the Balearic island of  Menorca . [ citation needed ] 
 Other [ edit ]

 Maó cheese : a hard  cow's milk   cheese  similar to  Grana Padano  or  Parmesan
