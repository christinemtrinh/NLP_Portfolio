 New American cuisine , also known as  Modern American cuisine  or  Contemporary American cuisine , is the wave of modernized  cooking  predominantly served at upscale  fine dining  restaurants in the United States, originating in the 1980s. [1]  New American cuisine is generally a type of  fusion cuisine  which assimilates flavors from the  melting pot  of traditional American cooking techniques mixed with foreign and sometimes  molecular gastronomy  components. [2] [3]  There is often a focus on fresh, local, and seasonal  farm-to-table  ingredients. [4] 
 The movement was popularized in the 1990s by various celebrity chefs, including  Wolfgang Puck ,  Jeremiah Tower ,  Alice Waters , and  Jonathan Waxman . [1] 
 New American cuisine features innovative use of seasoning and sauces. Originally based on  French ,  nouvelle , and  traditional American  cuisine, New American has since progressed to include elements of  Mediterranean ,  Latin American ,  Asian , and other cuisines. [5] [6] [7]
