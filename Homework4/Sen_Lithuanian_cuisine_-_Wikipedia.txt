Lithuanian cuisine features products suited to the cool and moist northern climate of Lithuania: barley, potatoes, rye, beets, greens, berries, and mushrooms are locally grown, and dairy products are one of its specialties.
Various ways of pickling were used to preserve food for winter.
Soups are extremely popular, and are widely regarded as the key to good health.
Since it shares its climate and agricultural practices with Northern Europe, Lithuanian cuisine has much in common with its Baltic neighbors and, in general, northern countries.
Longlasting agricultural and foraging traditions along with a variety of influences during the country's history formed Lithuanian cuisine.
[citation needed] German traditions have had an influence on Lithuanian cuisine, introducing pork and potato dishes, such as potato pudding (kugelis or kugel) and intestines stuffed with mashed potato (vėdarai), as well as the baroque tree cake known as Šakotis.
Lithuanian noblemen usually hired French chefs - French cuisine influence came to Lithuania in this way.
[1] The most exotic influence is Eastern (Karaite) cuisine, and the dish kibinai which became popular in Lithuania.
Lithuanians and other nations that lived in Grand Duchy of Lithuania also share some dishes and beverages.
Lithuanian cuisine also influenced Ruthenian and Polish cuisines.
[2] The earliest mentions of food and agriculture of the Baltic people (Aestii) and related customs comes from Tacitus circa 98 AD: "they cultivate grain and other crops with a perseverance unusual among the indolent Germans.
"[3] The 9th-century traveler Wulfstan attested usage of mead among West Balts: "There is a great deal of honey and fishing.
The king and the most powerful men drink mare's milk, the poor men and the slaves drink mead.
...
There is no ale brewed among the Este but there is plenty of mead.
"[4] In the 14th century, Lithuania almost all today known cereals and legume were grown, but rye was the most popular, since it was easier to grow in the Northern European climate and the crop was more predictable.
In the hillfort of Maišiagala in the layer of 13–14th century about 20 sorts of various cereals and legumes were found – winter and summer rye, wheat, barley, oat, millet, buckwheat, lentil, vetches, peas, broad beans.
[5] In the Middle Ages, hunting was the main way to provide oneself with meat.
It is known that Vytautas The Great before the Battle of Žalgiris organized a big hunting in the Baltvyžis forest and prepared barrels of salt-cured meat for the army.
Game was also a staple of noblemen: wisents, aurochs, and deer were hunted.
Lithuania had long-lasting wars (about 200 years) with Teutonic Order.
It also kept diplomatic relationships with it, during which various presents were exchanged - it is known what Teutonic Order sent a rare wine to Anna, Grand Duchess of Lithuania, wife of Vytautas the Great, in 1416.
At this time Lithuanian nobleman already imported saffron, cinnamon, rice, pepper, raisins for their needs.
[6] The Congress of Lutsk, hosted by Vytautas the Great, was another example of medieval Lithuanian cuisine.
Chronicles report that seven hundred barrels of honey, wine, 700 oxen, 1,400 sheep, hundreds of elk, wild boar, and other dishes were consumed daily.
Traditional Lithuanian hunting and landscape, still existing conflicts between paganism and Christianity was described by Nicolaus Hussovianus in his Latin poem Carmen de statura, feritate ac venatione bisontis (A Song about the Appearance, Savagery and Hunting of the Bison, 1523).
Many culinary innovations came from Italy with Bona Sforza, Grand Duchess consort of Lithuania.
Bona Sforza introduced the fork and traditional Italian food – olives, olive oil; made wine and wheat flour more popular.
Parsnips, cauliflowers, spinach, and even artichokes were introduced and grown.
It is assumed that Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania had their own kitchen garden.Daughter of Bona Sforza, Catherine Jagiellon after marrying John III of Sweden introduced the fork and other cultural habits to Sweden.
[7] Son of Bona Sforza Sigismund II Augustus had an Italian chef Sigismondo Fanelli, living in Vilnius, Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania.
The court account books of Alexander Jagiellon mention court officials also associated with the kitchen: the titles Master of the Kitchen was the magnate Petras Aleknaitis, while the actual functions of the kitchen-master were carried by kitchen senior Raclovas, other Kitchen Master is also mentioned – Mikalojus Jundilaitis and the Carver Butrimas Jokūbaitis Nemiraitis.
In the 16th century, a water pipe was built from Vingriai springs straight to the kitchen of Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania in Vilnius.
[8] In the sale contract made in 1623 by Elisabeth Sophie von Brandenburg, wife of Jonušas Radvila and Jonušas Kiška, she sold a garden in Vilnius.
The text of the treaty has very detailed mentionings of the garden plants such as grafted apple trees, pears, plums (prunus domestica), cherries, wild cherries, vitis, hawthorns, dog roses.
A garden for Italian vegetables (as they called back then) is also very detailed.
That is potatoes, artichokes, asparagus, lamb's lettuce, rucola, garden cress, spinach, melons, beets, rushes, French parsley, Italian onions, lettuce, chicory.
And spices and decorative shrubs: anise, peppermints, estragon, dill, true indigo and junipers.
Wooden orangerie is also mentioned which was used to grow fig-trees and common walnuts.
[9] In XVI rulers and nobleman of Lithuania consumed grapes, oranges, melons, raspberries, strawberries, cherries, and plums, imported ginger, cinnamon, almonds and pepper.
The growing of potatoes in Lithuania is known from the 17th century, but it became more widespread only in the 18th century.
[10] Archeological finds at the place of the Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania revealed a lot of information about the food eaten, cutlery and serving of the rulers of Lithuania.
[11] First explorer of the Lithuanian flora, botanist Jurgis Pabrėža described spicery growing in Lithuania.
In 18th-century and 19th-century recipes à la Lithuanienne appeared in the French culinary books.
The romantic image of Lithuania was associated with lush forests and game – no wonder the recipes à la Lithuanienne were mostly dishes prepared from moose, bear, or grey partridge.
La Cuisine classique by Urbain Dubois and Émile Bernard, published in 1856 contained Lithuanian recipes of goose soup and sauce.
A culinary book by Alphonse Petit La gastronomie en Russie, published in 1900 included eight Lithuanian recipes.
[12][13] In the twentieth century in interwar Lithuania, many girls attended Amatų mokykla (The Trade School), where young women were trained to prepare various types of dishes and learned various recipes, proper table manners, economy and running the household.
These schools led to spreading of similar recipes throughout the country.
During the past years, restaurants in Lithuania emerged which specialize in historic Lithuanian cuisine, culinary heritage and its interpretations.
Part of Olaus Magnus' map depicting Lithuania: Lithuanian type of crop trade ships (naves frumentarie) – vytinė is seen close to Vilnius, also beehives protection from the bears(on the right side) Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania in Vilnius.
Many European novelties and fashions like opera and Italian or French cuisine reached Lithuania through this Palace.
Logo of the Lithuanian Culinary Heritage Foundation used to mark the food produced using traditional Lithuanian way.
One of the oldest and most fundamental Lithuanian food products was and is rye bread.
Rye bread was eaten every day for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
Bread played an important role in family rituals and agrarian ceremonies.
[14]Traditionally, the centerpiece of Lithuanian cuisine is dark rye bread (ruginė duona) which is used more often than light wheat breads.
The archeological finds reveal that bread in the 9th - 14th centuries in Lithuania was very similar to the current rye bread.
[15] The dough is usually based on a sourdough starter, and includes some wheat flour to lighten the finished product.
Traditionally each home had its own sourdough yeast – raugas, which also had symbolical meaning of the home.
Rye bread is often eaten as an open-faced sandwich, buttered or spread with cheese.
It is sometimes flavored with caraway, or with some onion.
Traditional bread is baked on sweet flag leaves.
Bread baking was considered an important ritual.
[16] Bread was baked in a special oven for bread - duonkepė krosnis.Lithuanian proverb says - Be aukso apsieis, be duonos ne (One can manage without gold, but not without bread).
Some varieties of Lithuanian bread contain whole seeds of rye and wheat; this type of bread is referred to as grūdėtoji, i.e.
"seeded" bread.
The most commonly used vegetable in Lithuanian recipes is the potato; in its simplest forms, it is boiled, baked, or sauteed, often garnished with dill, but a tremendous[citation needed] variety of potato recipes exist.
Potatoes were introduced into Lithuania in the late 18th century, were found to prosper in its climate, and soon became indispensable.
Cucumbers, dill pickles, radishes and greens are quite popular.
Beets (burokai) are grown more widely than in other areas of the world and are often used for making borscht and side dishes.
Cabbage is another popular vegetable, used as a basis for soups, or wrapped around fillings (balandėliai).
Tomatoes are now available year-round in stores, but those home-grown in family greenhouses are still considered superior.
Sorrel is grown in the gardens for soup and salad.
Lithuanian herbs and seasonings include mustard seed, horseradish (krienai), dill (krapai), caraway seed (kmynai), garlic, coriander, oregano, bay leaf, juniper berries (kadagio uogos), hemp seeds and fruit essences.
Vanilla and pepper were scarce during the Soviet occupation, but were welcomed back again after restitution of the independence.
The cuisine is relatively mild.
[citation needed] Pickling is a popular way to prepare vegetables for winter or just to give them a particular flavour.
Cucumbers, beets, dills, homegrown tomatoes, onions, garlic is pickled and available all year round.
[citation needed] Linseed oil was moderately popular.
[citation needed] One of the prides of Lithuanian cuisine is its wide use of wild berries and mushrooms and this foraging tradition is still alive.
Mushrooming is a popular pastime from mid-summer to autumn.
As a staple, mushrooms are usually harvested in the forest; occasionally they are purchased at roadside markets, especially on the road in the Dzūkija region from Druskininkai to Vilnius; the purchasing of mushrooms in shops is rare.
Despite its status as a delicacy, mushrooms are thought of by many Lithuanians as hard to digest.
Dried mushrooms are used as a seasoning.
A number of mushroom species are harvested from the wild, including: Baravykas is the most valued and sought-after species; the primary usages are drying and marinating.
Dried baravykas has a strong pleasant scent and is used as a seasoning in soups and sauces.
Voveraitė is often used fresh as a seasoning in soups or sauteed.
The most common dish using this mushroom is voveraitė sauteed with chopped bulb onions and potatoes.
Gudukas, arguably the most locally abundant of edible mushrooms due to its lower popularity, is usually marinated.
Other edible mushrooms, such as lepšė (Leccinum scabrum), raudonviršis or raudonikis (literally, "red-topped") (Leccinum aurantiacum), makavykas (Suillus variegatus), šilbaravykis (Xerocomus badius), are more rare, but are also gathered and may be used in the same ways as baravykas.
Wild berries are also gathered or, even more frequently than mushrooms, purchased at roadside markets or shops.
Bilberries (mėlynės) and lingonberries (bruknės) are the two most abundant species of wild berries.
Cranberries (spanguolės) are valued, but their cultivation is limited to certain boggy areas, such as those adjacent to Čepkeliai Marsh.
Sour cranberry or lingonberry jam and sweet bilberry jam are all considered excellent sauces for pancakes (blynai).
Lingonberry jam is occasionally used as a dressing for fried chicken or turkey or as a sauce for other savory dishes.
Fresh bilberries may be put into a cold milk soup.
Wild strawberries (žemuogės) are relatively scarce and are usually gathered for immediate consumption.
Boletus, the "King of Mushrooms" Chanterelles are popular mushrooms in Lithuania Butter-mushroom Lingonberry Bilberry Strawberry Glyceria fluitans (paprastoji monažolė).
The seeds were used for food and mentioned as nature goods of Lithuania Minor along with beeswax, honey, amber and timber.
[17] Pastinaca sativa (paprastasis pastarnokas) was a popular food before the appearance of potatoes.
K.Donelaitis in his poem The Seasons promoted growing of parsnips.
Apples, plums, and pears, which grow well in Lithuania, are the most commonly used fruit.
[citation needed] Because they cannot tolerate frost, tropical fruit such as citrus, bananas and pineapples must be imported, and hence were used less often in the past; however, these fruits are now becoming more typical and are widely consumed.
During the autumn harvest, fruit is often simmered and spiced to create fruit stews (kompots).
Gooseberries (agrastai) and currants (serbentai) are widely cultivated; they are sweetened, made into jams and baked goods, and provide a piquant touch to desserts.
Small local producers make fine fruit wines from raspberries, and especially blackcurrants; apple icewine is also produced.
Apple cheese, which is considered a dessert, is very popular in autumn.
Oldest apple cheese recipe in Lithuania was found in the book of Radvila family chef from the 17th century.
Sea buckthorn is used for juice and as a garnish.
The most frequently used meat is pork, followed by beef, lamb, chicken, turkey, and duck;[citation needed] for immediate consumption it is often grilled, or dusted with breadcrumbs and sauteed, in a dish similar to schnitzel.
[citation needed] For bigger gatherings, oven roasts are prepared.
[citation needed] The need for meat preservation no longer presents the urgency that it did during the Soviet occupation or previous times of trouble, but many favorite techniques survive, include brining, salting, drying, and smoking.
There are many varieties of smoked pork, including ham and a soft sausage with a large-grained filling; these are served as a main course or thinly sliced in sandwiches.
Skilandis is a popular Lithuanian sausage and the original production form has been registered as an EU and UK Traditional Speciality Guaranteed under the name Lietuviškas skilandis.
[18] The art of meat smoking has long traditions in Lithuania – the right choice of woods, heat or distance from fire required a mastery.
Skilandis was smoked for four weeks in a special room – kaminas – which was used for cooking.
Smoking, curing and other meat preparation techniques differ in Lithuanian regions.
Freshwater fish with exception of herring was the most popular fish in Lithuania.
Fish, such as pike, zander or perch, are often baked whole or stuffed.
Herring is marinated, baked, fried, or served in aspic.
Since the 19th century, herring was imported to Lithuania from Norway, Stavanger.
[19] Salmon is also a popular dish often served with a cream sauce, vegetables, and rice.
Before building dams after Soviet occupation, salmon was quite abundant fish in Lithuanian rivers.
Smoked fish such as eel or bream are popular entrees and appetizers in areas near the Baltic Sea, especially in Neringa.
[citation needed] Crayfish are also popular and are usually eaten in the summertime as a delicacy and a side dish served with beer.
[citation needed] Lithuania is known for quality dairy products.
Dairy products play an important role in Lithuanian cuisine; curd cheese (similar to cottage cheese) may be sweet, sour, seasoned with caraway, fresh, or cured until semi-soft.
Lithuanian butter and cream are unusually rich.
Sour cream is so prominent in Lithuanian cuisine, that it is eaten with everything - meat, fish, pancakes, soups, desserts, salads, and so on.
The sour cream Žemaitiškas kastinys is registered in the EU and UK as a Traditional Speciality Guaranteed (TSG).
[20] Lithuanian curd snacks called sūreliai are popular too.
Also, a big variety of different soured milk products are available in the supermarkets, though some people still prefer making their own soured milk.
A Milk road route was created which leads through important objects of milk production in Lithuania.
[citation needed] Variety of milk is large – milk, buttermilk, soured milk, kefir, cream, yogurt.
Most traditional are buttermilk and soured milk, eaten with boiled potatoes.
[citation needed] The traditional Lithuanian curd cheese Lietuviškas varškės sūris has been registered as a Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) in the EU and UK.
[21] The most popular way of eating Lithuanian non-fermented white cheese is with fresh honey; it can also be cooked with spices and enjoyed with tea.
Food historians estimate that the curd cheese was known for 4-6 thousands of years.
[22]Lithuanians started fermenting hard cheese around the 16th century in the region of Samogitia.
Across Samogitian borders, this cheese was known as Lithuanian cheese.Historically there were not many varieties of cheese in Lithuania, due to low levels of lactose intolerance.
[citation needed] Milk products were usually consumed fresh, or slightly fermented.Semi-hard cheese Liliputas in 2015 was registered as an EU Protected Geographical Indication (PGI).
[23] Hard cheese Džiugas ripens for at least 12 months, is popular among gourmets and being used as to flavour recipes.
Džiugas in 2019 was registered as a Protected Geographical Indication.

Dzūkija, the most forested region is famous for mushrooms, berries, buckwheat dishes such as buckwheat cake (grikinė boba) and boletus soup.
Meat curing by smoking is not practiced in Dzûkija.
Instead, the salted cuts of meat remain in brine or are hung and air-dried.
Different types of woods were used for smoking the meat - in Samogitia and Aukštaitija alder tree with combination of juniper was used, in Suvalkija - only alder.

The meal structure of the day is also influenced by the ancient life in the farm or village.
Usual workday was split into three parts - the work from the early morning till breakfast (pusryčiai), work before breakfast and dinner (pietūs) and work between dinner and evening meal (vakarienė).
[24] Breakfast was considered the most filling meal, dinner was considered a lighter meal and the evening meal was the lightest.In the summer then the workday was the longest, light meal before breakfast (priešpusryčiai) and the meal before dinner and evening meal - pavakariai was provided.
Up to this day Lithuanians eat quite filling breakfast and really light evening meals.

Local breweries are enjoying a renaissance.
Beer is the most common alcoholic beverage.
Lithuania has a long farmhouse beer tradition, first mentioned in 11th-century chronicles.
Beer was brewed for ancient Baltic festivities and rituals.
[27] Ancient Lithuanian god for brewing beer and mead was Ragutis or Rūgutis.
21 September was known as the festive Alutinis, Koštuvės or Ragautuvės - the first beer was made using the harvest of the running year.
[28] Lithuania is not very well known for its beer worldwide, but it is one of the few countries in Europe to have an independent beer tradition in which breweries do not simply brew beers in styles developed elsewhere.
Traditional farmhouse brewing has survived into the present day in Lithuania, and during Soviet times such brewing started to be expanded to a larger scale.
After independence, this process gathered speed and soon there were more than 200 breweries in the country.
Many of these have since gone out of business, but Lithuania still has about 80 breweries, of which perhaps 60-70 produce beers in styles unknown in the rest of the world.
Some of these are very close to the traditional brews made by farmers, while others have developed out of that tradition as a consequence of the growth of the traditional brewers into reasonably large regional breweries.
Farmhouse brewing survived to a greater extent in Lithuania than anywhere else, and through accidents of history the Lithuanians then developed a commercial brewing culture from their unique farmhouse traditions.
[29] Lithuania is top 5 by consumption of beer per capita in Europe in 2015, counting 75 active breweries, 32 of them are microbreweries.
[30] The microbrewery scene in Lithuania has been growing in later years, with a number of bars focusing on these beers popping up in Vilnius and also in other parts of the country.
Local beers have started to attract international attention after beer bloggers discovered the country, inspiring a major feature article in Beer Connoisseur magazine, prompting the New York Times to list Lithuania as one of the 42 places to visit in 2013 on the strength of the village beers.
Beer routes are organized through the main breweries in northern Lithuania.
Midus is said to be the most ancient Lithuanian alcoholic beverage; it is a variety of mead made from honey.
Baltic people were making midus for thousands of years.
One of the first mentionings of Balts and mead was by the 9th-century traveller Wulfstan of Hedeby, who visited Prussians.
Old Lithuanian mead was made from a solution of honey and water simmered with various spices, such as thyme, lemon, cinnamon, cherries, linden blossoms, juniper berries, and hops.
[31]Oldest recipe of Lithuanian midus was recorded in a book by Olaus Magnus Historia de Gentibus Septentrionalibus, published in Rome in 1555.
[32] Midus was considered a drink of nobleman and gentry.
Since 16th century midus started to compete with imported vine, but it was known and was still very popular in Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania.
[33]  Today Midus is produced by several companies and is to be found in the majority of liquor shops.
Craft mead producing is also becoming popular.
Traditional Lithuanian midus Stakliškės, fermented up to 90 days has a Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) label.
[34] Fruit and berry wines being made in Lithuania by several companies.
Industrial production of fruit and berry wines was started by Balys Karazija in 1926 in Anykščiai.
