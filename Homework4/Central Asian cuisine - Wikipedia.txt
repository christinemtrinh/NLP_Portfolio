 Culinary traditions of Central Asia 
   Meal served on a  dastarkhan  for the holiday of Nowruz 
 Central Asian cuisine  has been influenced by  Persian ,  Indian ,  Arab ,  Turkish ,  Chinese ,  Mongol ,  African , and  Russian  cultures, as well as the culinary traditions of other varied nomadic and sedentary civilizations. Contributing to the culinary diversity were the migrations of  Uyghur ,  Slav ,  Korean ,  Tatar ,  Dungan  and  German people  to the region. [1] [2] 
 
 
 Background [ edit ] 
 Nomadic peoples of the  Eurasian steppe  had simple  subsistence diets  based primarily on  dairy products , and to a lesser extent game and plant-based foods. [1]  Excavations at  Adji Kui  in the  Kara Kum Desert  of Turkmenistan have shown the site was occupied between 2400 and 1300 BC. [3]  Archaeobotanical evidence has shown that crop diffusion was ongoing across the mountain valleys and oasis towns of Central Asia as early as the  3rd millennium BC . The earliest evidence of domesticated grains bring used by nomadic herders (2800 to 2300 BC) has been found at the Tasbas and  Begash  sites of the Kazakh highland steppe.  Triticum turgidum  and  panicum miliaceum  found at highland campsites in Central Eurasia [4]  represent the first known transmission of these domesticated grains from China and the region south of the Syr Darya river into Central Eurasia. [5] 
 Central Asian cooking techniques were influenced by the lack of water.  Poplar trees ,  saxaul  and animal dung were the primary fuel sources used in  tandyr  ovens, designed to maximize the heat gained from the limited supply of fuel, where  flatbread ,  samsa  and meats were cooked. Soups, stews and steamed dumplings were cooked in single cauldron pots. [1] 
 
   Uzbek  manti  (dumpling) soup 
 Persian cuisine in the golden age of Iran was highly sophisticated with ingredients from China and the Mediterranean. Turkic influence was seen in  manti  dumplings, wheat porridge called  sumalak  and assorted dairy products.  Mahmud al-Kashgari  describes  pit cooking , baking in earthenware and grilling. [1]  Even after the disruption of the 13th century  Mongol invasions , Iranian and Turkic culinary traditions carried on in  Ottoman palace cuisine  and have survived into the 20th century. [1] 
 Tamerlane 's empire is considered the last significant Central Asian Empire of the 14th century, covering the territories of modern day  Baghdad , the  Volga  and  Delhi . The  Mughal Empire , founded by a descendant of Tamerlane's named  Babur , was noted for cultural achievements, among this a sophisticated cuisine that blended Indian and Persian elements into a unique style. Fragrant spices like nutmeg, cinnamon and mace were used to flavor dishes, that were served with thick sauces made from yogurt and crushed nuts. The rice pilafs were sophisticated. Desserts were flavored with rose. Modern Indian cuisine is heavily influenced by Mughal cuisine, including the grilled tandoori meats and yogurt sauces. [1] 
 
 Characteristics [ edit ] 
 The culinary cultures of Central Asia may be divided as follows: nomadic or urban; highland or lowland; and Mongol, Turkic or Iranian. The nomadic diet based on meat and dairy products is found in Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. While lamb and beef, breads, baked pies and homemade noodles are common across the region,  besh barmak  (a lamb dish eaten with the hands) and horse meat are found only in some regions, mostly Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. [2] 
 
   Uzbek  nan  bread cooked in a  tandyr  oven 
 The typical dishes of the settled Turkic peoples - Uzbek and Uighurs - are pilafs,  kebabs , stews, noodles, tandyr flatbreads and savory pastries. The Iranian cultural influence is seen in the  cuisine of Tajikistan  and southern Uzbekistan, reaching into northern Pakistan and India, where rice and stewed vegetable dishes are more elaborately spiced. [6] 
 Some common ingredients and flavors can be found in the varied cuisines of region. These include generous use of tail fat from sheep and  onion , hot peppers, black pepper, cumin, sesame seed,  nigella , basil, cilantro, parsley, mint and dill. These are used in all sorts of dishes including soups, salads and pilafs. Less common are cinnamon and saffron. [7] 
 Tea is the most popular beverage. Green tea with cream is more common in  Kyrgyz cuisine , while black tea is more common in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. [7]  A  chaikhana  is a Central Asian  teahouse  where people gather to socialize over tea. Traditional dishes are served like  shorpo  (soup),  shashlik  (grilled meats),  mastoba ,  manty ,  pilov  and  samsa . (Vodka is sometimes called  ak cha  or "white tea"). [2] 
 Kumis  is a traditional drink of the  Turkic peoples  of Central Asia. It is a  fermented dairy product  traditionally made from  mare's milk  or  donkey milk .
 A meal typically begins with tea or fresh  tandyr nan  bread, followed by soup ( shorpo ) or pulled noodles ( lagman ). The main course is often a  pilov  dish with meat, rice and carrots; hundreds of variations of the basic pilov are possible with the addition of different herbs, dried fruits like raisins and apricots, nuts and other ingredients. After the main course a guest may be offered dumplings or grilled skewers of meat, and fresh fruit often takes the place of a final dessert course. [2]  In many parts of Central Asia the meal is served on the floor with many plates laid out on a on a  dastarkhan  cloth. [1] 
 
 Dishes [ edit ] 
 Desserts [ edit ] 
 Halva  is made from  sesame seeds , with flour, sugar, milk and nuts. [1]  Fruit  compote  with nuts is a typical dessert dish. There are hundreds of melon varieties grown locally in Central Asia, and plums, apples, apricots, pears, berries and cherries are locally available. In addition to these pomegranates, fig, peaches and persimmons are imported. [8] 
 The local version of  baklava  is called  paklama . For Eid celebrations, deep-fried dough balls drenched in honey syrup called  çäkçäk  are piled into mounds, along with sugar-dusted dough spirals called  urama . Kyrgyz  boorsog  is a similar deep-fried dough dish, called  bogursak  in Turkmenistan, and  baursaki  in Kazakhstan. [8] 
 Not traditional to the regional cuisine, European-style layered cakes and pastries are available in modern times. Nuts, honey, fruits and  halva  remain common traditional choices. [8] 
 
 Fruits [ edit ] 
 The region's  melons  are renowned, and cherries, apples, plums, peaches and figs are also locally grown. Fruit is consumed as a snack, fresh or dried, at all times of day. [1] 
 
 Grains [ edit ] 
   Uighur  pulled noodle dish  laghman 
 The main grain crops of Central Asia are  millet ,  rice ,  wheat  and  barley . Rice and wheat are used to make the staple dishes of  flatbread  and  noodles . [1]  Wheat flour is used to make traditional flatbread called  tandyr nan ,  dumplings  called  manti , smaller dumplings called  chuchvara  and stuffed pastries called  samsa . [7] 
 Millet is the main ingredient of the beverage  boza . Similar in flavor to  beer ,  boza  is made in  Kazakhstan  and  Kyrgyzstan . [1] 
 Rice pilaf is the most iconic Central Asian dish, with  Uzbek cuisine  offering a multitude of varieties, often mixed with legumes for added protein. [7] 
 From Turkic cuisine came the flatbreads  yufka  and  çörek ,  katmer  pastry and a noodle dish called  tutmaç . [1]   Beliashi  are open-faced pies, cooked in a skillet, from  Kazakh cuisine . [7] 
 
 Vegetables [ edit ] 
 The most common vegetables are turnips, tomatoes, radishes, onions, peas, red peppers and cucumbers.  Turp  is the local name for a large green radish that is usually eaten fresh as a side dish or salad. "Yellow carrot" ( sabzi turisida ) is actually a type of  parsnip  that is used in  pilaf  dishes. Squash are a common ingredient for stews, soups, dumplings, and  samsa . [1] 
 Both written history and molecular genetic studies indicate that the domestic  carrot  has a single origin in Central Asia. [9] [10]  Its wild ancestors probably originated in  Persia  (regions of which are now  Iran  and  Afghanistan ).
