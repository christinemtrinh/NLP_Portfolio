 Tamil cuisine  is a culinary style originating in the southern  Indian state  of  Tamil Nadu  and other countries of  South Asia  like  Sri Lanka . [1]  Meats, along with  rice ,  legumes , and  lentils , are also popular.  Dairy  products and  tamarind  are used to provide sour flavors. On special occasions, traditional Tamil dishes are served in a traditional manner, using banana leaves in place of utensils. After eating, the banana leaves are then used as a secondary food for cattle. A typical breakfast meal consists of  idli  or  dosa  with chutney. Lunch includes  rice ,  sambar ,  curd ,  kuzhambu , and  rasam .
 
 
 Typical meals [ edit ] 
   A vegetarian meal in Tamil Nadu 
 Saappadu  (a typical meal), along with other Tamil dishes are served on a banana leaf (vaazhai illai), which adds flavor. Puddings such as  payasam  are eaten first.  Coffee  and  tea  are the staple drinks. [2] 
 "Virundhu" refers to the core elements of Tamil cuisine offered to the guests on special occasions such as festivals and marriage ceremony.  Rice staples , tomato rice,  Paruppu ,  sambar ,  rasam ,  kuzhambu ,  poriyal  and  koottu  are added with  buttermilk  or  curd  to prepare  pachadi . Dry and fresh fruits or vegetables are also used to prepare traditional cuisine. They serve  salt ,  pickles ,  vada ,  payasam ,  appalam  and  aviyal . After the meal, a banana and a betel leaf ( paan ) with areca nuts and limestone paste are served to promote digestion. Before eating traditional cuisine, people clean the  banana leaf  with water. It is used as a large dining table sheet to serve food for guests and family members on which the food items are placed.
