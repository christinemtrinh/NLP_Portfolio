   Seafood includes any form of food taken from the sea. 
   Annual seafood consumption per capita (2017) [1] 
 Seafood  is any form of  sea life  regarded as food by humans, prominently including  fish  and  shellfish . Shellfish include various species of  molluscs  (e.g. bivalve molluscs such as  clams ,  oysters  and  mussels , and  cephalopods  such as octopus and squid),  crustaceans  (e.g. shrimp, crabs, and lobster), and  echinoderms  (e.g. sea cucumbers and sea urchins). Historically,  marine mammals  such as  cetaceans  ( whales  and  dolphins ) as well as  seals  have been eaten as food, though that happens to a lesser extent in modern times. Edible sea plants such as some  seaweeds  and  microalgae  are widely eaten as  sea vegetables  around the world, especially in Asia. 
 Seafood is an important source of (animal)  protein  in many  diets  around the world, especially in coastal areas.  Semi-vegetarians  who consume seafood as the only source of meat are said to adhere to  pescetarianism .
 The harvesting of  wild seafood  is usually known as  fishing  or  hunting , while the cultivation and farming of seafood is known as  aquaculture  and  fish farming  (in the case of fish). Most of the seafood harvest is consumed by humans, but a significant proportion is used as  fish food  to farm other fish or rear  farm animals . Some seafoods (i.e.  kelp ) are used as food for other plants (a  fertilizer ). In these ways, seafoods are used to produce further food for human consumption. Also, products such as  fish oil ,  spirulina  tablets, fish collagen,  chitin  are made from seafoods. Some seafood is fed to  aquarium  fish, or used to feed domestic pets such as  cats . A small proportion is used in medicine, or is used industrially for nonfood purposes (e.g.  leather ).

   Various foods depicted in an Egyptian burial chamber, including fish, c. 1400 BCE. 
 The harvesting, processing, and consuming of seafoods are ancient practices with archaeological evidence dating back well into the  Paleolithic . [2] [3]  Findings in a sea cave at  Pinnacle Point  in  South Africa  indicate  Homo sapiens  (modern humans) harvested marine life as early as 165,000 years ago, [2]  while the  Neanderthals , an extinct human species contemporary with early  Homo sapiens , appear to have been eating seafood at sites along the Mediterranean coast beginning around the same time. [4]  Isotopic analysis of the skeletal remains of  Tianyuan man , a 40,000-year-old  anatomically modern human  from eastern Asia, has shown that he regularly consumed freshwater fish. [5] [6]   Archaeology  features such as  shell middens , [7]  discarded fish bones and  cave paintings  show that sea foods were important for survival and consumed in significant quantities. During this period, most people lived a  hunter-gatherer  lifestyle and were, of necessity, constantly on the move. However, early examples of permanent settlements (though not necessarily permanently occupied), such as those at  Lepenski Vir , were almost always associated with fishing as a major source of food.
 The ancient  river   Nile  was full of fish; fresh and dried fish were a staple food for much of the population. [8]  The  Egyptians  had implements and methods for fishing and these are illustrated in  tomb  scenes, drawings, and  papyrus  documents. Some representations hint at fishing being pursued as a pastime.
 
 World  fisheries  harvest, both wild and farmed, in million tonnes, 1950–2010 [9] World  fisheries  harvest, wild capture versus aquaculture production, in million tonnes 1950–2010 [9] 
 Fishing scenes are rarely represented in  ancient Greek  culture, a reflection of the low social status of fishing. However,  Oppian of Corycus , a Greek author wrote a major treatise on sea fishing, the  Halieulica  or  Halieutika , composed between 177 and 180. This is the earliest such work to have survived to the modern day. The consumption of fish varied in accordance with the wealth and location of the household. In the Greek islands and on the coast, fresh fish and seafood ( squid ,  octopus , and  shellfish ) were common. They were eaten locally but more often transported inland.  Sardines  and  anchovies  were regular fare for the citizens of Athens. They were sometimes sold fresh, but more frequently salted. A  stele  of the late 3rd century BCE from the small Boeotian city of  Akraiphia , on  Lake Copais , provides us with a list of fish prices. The cheapest was  skaren  (probably  parrotfish ) whereas  Atlantic bluefin tuna  was three times as expensive. [10]  Common salt water fish were  yellowfin tuna ,  red mullet ,  ray ,  swordfish  or  sturgeon , a delicacy which was eaten salted. Lake Copais itself was famous in all Greece for its  eels , celebrated by the hero of  The Acharnians . Other fresh water fish were  pike-fish ,  carp  and the less appreciated  catfish .
 Pictorial evidence of  Roman  fishing comes from  mosaics . [11]  At a certain time the  goatfish  was considered the epitome of luxury, above all because its scales exhibit a bright red colour when it dies out of water. For this reason these fish were occasionally allowed to die slowly at the table. There even was a recipe where this would take place  in garo , in the  sauce . At the beginning of the Imperial era, however, this custom suddenly came to an end, which is why  mullus  in the feast of  Trimalchio  (see  the  Satyricon ) could be shown as a characteristic of the  parvenu , who bores his guests with an unfashionable display of dying fish. [ citation needed ] 
 In  medieval  times, seafood was less prestigious than other animal meats, and often seen as merely an alternative to meat on fast days. Still, seafood was the mainstay of many coastal populations.  Kippers  made from herring caught in the  North Sea  could be found in markets as far away as  Constantinople . [12]  While large quantities of fish were eaten fresh, a large proportion was salted, dried, and, to a lesser extent, smoked.  Stockfish , cod that was split down the middle, fixed to a pole and dried, was very common, though preparation could be time-consuming, and meant beating the dried fish with a mallet before soaking it in water. A wide range of  mollusks  including  oysters ,  mussels  and  scallops  were eaten by coastal and river-dwelling populations, and freshwater  crayfish  were seen as a desirable alternative to meat during fish days. Compared to meat, fish was much more expensive for inland populations, especially in Central Europe, and therefore not an option for most. [13] 
 Modern knowledge of the reproductive cycles of aquatic species has led to the development of  hatcheries  and improved techniques of  fish farming  and  aquaculture . Better understanding of the  hazards  of eating raw and undercooked fish and shellfish has led to improved preservation methods and processing.
 
 
 Types of seafood [ edit ]

 The following table is based on the ISSCAAP classification (International Standard Statistical Classification of Aquatic Animals and Plants) used by the  FAO  for the purposes of collecting and compiling fishery statistics. [14]  The production figures have been extracted from the FAO FishStat database, [15]  and include both capture from wild fisheries and aquaculture production.

 marine pelagic 
 
 Pelagic fish  live and feed near the surface or in the  water column  of the sea, but not on the bottom of the sea. The main seafood groups can be divided into larger  predator fish  ( sharks ,  tuna ,  billfish ,  mahi-mahi ,  mackerel ,  salmon ) and smaller  forage fish  ( herring ,  sardines ,  sprats ,  anchovies ,  menhaden ). The smaller forage fish feed on plankton, and can accumulate toxins to a degree. The larger predator fish feed on the forage fish, and accumulate toxins to a much higher degree than the forage fish.
 
 33,974 
 
 
 
 
 marine demersal 
 
 Demersal fish  live and feed on or near the bottom of the sea. [16]  Some seafood groups are  cod ,  flatfish ,  grouper  and  stingrays . Demersal fish feed mainly on crustaceans they find on the sea floor, and are more sedentary than the pelagic fish. Pelagic fish usually have the red flesh characteristic of the powerful swimming muscles they need, while demersal fish usually have white flesh.

 diadromous 
 
 Diadromous fish  are fishes which migrate between the sea and fresh water. Some seafood groups are  salmon ,  shad ,  eels  and  lampreys .  See:  Salmon run .

 freshwater 
 
 Freshwater fish  live in  rivers ,  lakes ,  reservoirs , and  ponds . Some seafood groups are  carp ,  tilapia ,  catfish ,  bass , and  trout . Generally, freshwater fish lend themselves to  fish farming  more readily than the ocean fish, and the larger part of the tonnage reported here refers to farmed fish.

 molluscs 
 
 Molluscs  (from the Latin  molluscus , meaning  soft  ) are  invertebrates  with soft bodies that are not segmented like crustaceans.  Bivalves  and  gastropods  are protected by a  calcareous   shell  which grows as the mollusc grows.  Total for molluscs:   Total for molluscs:

 bivalves 
 
 Bivalves , sometimes referred to as  clams , have a protective shell in two hinged parts. A  valve  is the name used for the protective shell of a bivalve, so bivalve literally means  two shells . Important seafood bivalves include  oysters ,  scallops ,  mussels  and  cockles . Most of these are  filter feeders  which bury themselves in sediment on the  seabed  where they are safe from  predation . Others lie on the sea floor or attach themselves to rocks or other hard surfaces. Some, such as scallops, can  swim . Bivalves have long been a part of the diet of coastal communities. Oysters were  cultured  in ponds by the Romans and  mariculture  has more recently become an important source of bivalves for food.
 
 12,585
 
 
 
 
 gastropods 
 
 Aquatic  gastropods , also known as  sea snails , are univalves which means they have a protective shell that is  in a single piece . Gastropod literally means  stomach-foot , because they appear to crawl on their stomachs. Common seafood groups are  abalone ,  conch ,  limpets ,  whelks  and  periwinkles .
 
 526
 
 
 
 
 cephalopods 
 
 Cephalopods, except for  nautilus , are not protected by an external shell. Cephalopod literally means  head-foots , because they have limbs which appear to issue from their head. They have excellent vision and high intelligence. Cephalopods propel themselves with a water jet and lay down "smoke screens" with  ink . Examples are  octopus ,  squid  and  cuttlefish . They are eaten in many cultures. Depending on the species, the arms and sometimes other body parts are prepared in various ways. Octopus must be boiled properly to rid it of slime, smell, and residual ink. Squid are popular in Japan. In Mediterranean countries and in English-speaking countries squid are often referred to as  calamari . [17]  Cuttlefish is less eaten than squid, though it is popular in Italy and  dried, shredded cuttlefish  is a snack food in East Asia.  See:  Squid (food)   Octopus (food) .

 crustaceans 
 
 Crustaceans  (from Latin  crusta , meaning  crust  ) are invertebrates with segmented bodies protected by hard crusts (shells or  exoskeletons ), usually made of  chitin  and structured somewhat like a  knight's armour . The shells do not grow, and must periodically be shed or  moulted . Usually two legs or limbs issue from each segment. Most commercial crustaceans are  decapods , that is they have ten legs, and have  compound eyes  set on  stalks . Their shell turns pink or red when cooked. Total for crustaceans:

 shrimps 
 
 Shrimp and prawns , are small, slender, stalk-eyed ten-legged crustaceans with long spiny  rostrums . They are widespread, and can be found near the seafloor of most coasts and estuaries, as well as in rivers and lakes. They play important roles in the  food chain . There are numerous species, and usually there is a species adapted to any particular habitat. Any small crustacean which resembles a shrimp tends to be called one. [18]   See:  shrimp (food) ,  shrimp fishery ,  shrimp farming ,  freshwater prawn farming .

 crabs 
 
 Crabs are stalk-eyed ten-legged crustaceans, usually walk sideways, and have grasping  claws  as their front pair of limbs. They have small  abdomens , short  antennae , and a short  carapace  that is wide and flat. Also usually included are  king crabs  and  coconut crabs , even if these belongs to a different group of decapods than the true crabs.  See:  crab fisheries .

 lobsters 
 
 Clawed lobsters  and  spiny lobsters  are stalk-eyed ten-legged crustaceans with long abdomens. The clawed lobster has large asymmetrical claws for its front pair of limbs, one for crushing and one for cutting  (pictured) . The spiny lobster lacks the large claws, but has a long, spiny antennae and a spiny carapace. Lobsters are larger than most shrimp or crabs.  See:  lobster fishing .

 krill 
 
 Krill  are like baby shrimps, except they have external  gills  and more than ten legs ( swimming  plus feeding and grooming legs). They are found in oceans around the world where they  filter feed  in huge pelagic  swarms . [21]  Like shrimp, they are an important part of the marine food chain, converting  phytoplankton  into a form larger animals can consume. Each year, larger animals eat half the estimated biomass of krill (about 600 million tonnes). [21]  Humans consume krill in Japan and Russia, but most of the krill harvest is used to make  fish feed  and for extracting oil. Krill oil contains omega-3 fatty acids, similarly to  fish oil .  See:  Krill fishery .

 aquatic mammals 
 
 Marine mammals  form a diverse group of 128 species that rely on the ocean for their existence. [23]  Whale meat is still harvested from legal, non-commercial hunts. [24]  About one thousand  long-finned pilot whales  are still killed annually. [25]  Japan has resumed hunting for whales, which they call "research whaling". [26]  In modern Japan, two cuts of whale meat are usually distinguished: the belly meat and the more valued tail or fluke meat. Fluke meat can sell for $200 per kilogram, three times the price of belly meat. [27]   Fin whales  are particularly desired because they are thought to yield the best quality fluke meat. [28]  In  Taiji  in Japan and parts of Scandinavia such as the  Faroe Islands ,  dolphins  are traditionally considered food, and are killed in  harpoon  or  drive hunts . [29]   Ringed seals  are still an important food source for the people of  Nunavut [30]  and are also hunted and eaten in Alaska. [31]  The meat of sea mammals can be high in mercury, and may pose health dangers to humans when consumed. [32]  The FAO record only the reported numbers of aquatic mammals harvested, and not the tonnage. In 2010, they reported 2500 whales, 12,000 dolphins and 182,000 seals.  See:  marine mammals as food ,  whale meat ,  seal hunting .

 aquatic reptiles 
 
 Sea turtles  have long been valued as food in many parts of the world. Fifth century BC Chinese texts describe sea turtles as exotic delicacies. [33]  Sea turtles are caught worldwide, although in many countries it is illegal to hunt most species. [34]  Many coastal communities around the world depend on sea turtles as a source of protein, often gathering sea turtle eggs, and keeping captured sea turtles alive on their backs until needed for consumption. [35]  Most species of sea turtle are now endangered, and some are  critically endangered . [36]

 echinoderms 
 
 Echinoderms  are headless invertebrates, found on the  seafloor  in all oceans and at all depths. They are not found in fresh water. They usually have a five-pointed radial symmetry, and move, breathe and perceive with their retractable  tube feet . They are covered with a calcareous and spiky  test  or skin. The name echinoderm comes from the Greek  ekhinos  meaning  hedgehog , and  dermatos  meaning  skin . Echinoderms used for seafood include  sea cucumbers ,  sea urchins , and occasionally  starfish . Wild sea cucumbers are caught by divers and in China they are farmed commercially in artificial ponds. [37]  The  gonads  of both male and female sea urchins, usually called sea urchin  roe  or corals, [38]  are delicacies in many parts of the world. [39] [40]   See:  sea cucumber (food) .

 jellyfish 
 
 Jellyfish  are soft and gelatinous, with a body shaped like an umbrella or bell which pulsates for locomotion. They have long, trailing tentacles with stings for capturing prey. They are found free-swimming in the  water column  in all oceans, and are occasionally found in freshwater. Jellyfish must be dried within hours to prevent spoiling. In Japan they are regarded as a delicacy. Traditional processing methods are carried out by a jellyfish master. This involve a 20 to 40-day multi-phase procedure which starts with removing the gonads and  mucous membranes . The umbrella and oral arms are then treated with a mixture of  table salt  and  alum , and compressed. Processing reduces liquefaction, odor, the growth of spoilage organisms, and makes the jellyfish drier and more acidic, producing a crisp and crunchy texture. Only  scyphozoan  jellyfish belonging to the order  Rhizostomeae  are harvested for food; about 12 of the approximately 85 species. Most of the harvest takes place in southeast Asia.

 seaweed 
 
 Seaweed is a loose colloquial term which lacks a formal definition. Broadly, the term is applied to the larger,  macroscopic  forms of  algae , as opposed to  microalga . Examples of seaweed groups are the multicellular  red ,  brown  and  green algae . [44]  Edible seaweeds usually contain high amounts of fibre and, in contrast to terrestrial plants, contain a  complete protein . [45]  Seaweeds are used extensively as food in coastal cuisines around the world. Seaweed has been a part of diets in  China ,  Japan , and  Korea  since prehistoric times. [46]  Seaweed is also consumed in many traditional European societies, in  Iceland  and western  Norway , the Atlantic coast of  France , northern and western  Ireland ,  Wales  and some coastal parts of South West England, [47]  as well as Nova Scotia and Newfoundland.

 microphytes 
 
 Microphytes  are microscopic organisms, and can be algal, bacterial or fungal.  Microalgae  are another type of aquatic plant, and includes species that can be consumed by humans and animals. Some species of aquatic bacteria can also be used as seafood, such as  spirulina   (pictured in tablet form) , a type of  cyanobacteria .  See:  culture of microalgae in hatcheries .

 See also:  Fish processing  and  Fish preservation 
 Fish is a highly  perishable  product: the "fishy" smell of dead fish is due to the breakdown of  amino acids  into  biogenic amines  and  ammonia . [48] 
 Live  food fish  are often transported in tanks at high expense for an  international market  that prefers its seafood killed immediately before it is cooked. Delivery of live fish without water is also being explored. [49]  While some seafood  restaurants  keep live fish in  aquaria  for display purposes or for cultural beliefs, the majority of live fish are kept for dining customers. The live food fish trade in  Hong Kong , for example, is estimated to have driven imports of live food fish to more than 15,000  tonnes  in 2000. Worldwide sales that year were estimated at US$400 million, according to the World Resources Institute. [50] 
 If the  cool chain  has not been adhered to correctly, food products generally decay and become harmful before the  validity date  printed on the package. As the potential harm for a consumer when eating rotten fish is much larger than for example with dairy products, the  U.S. Food and Drug Administration  (FDA) has introduced regulation in the USA requiring the use of a  time temperature indicator  on certain fresh chilled seafood products. [51] 
 Because fresh fish is highly perishable, it must be eaten promptly or discarded; it can be kept for only a short time. In many countries, fresh fish are  filleted  and displayed for sale on a bed of  crushed ice  or  refrigerated . Fresh fish is most commonly found near bodies of water, but the advent of refrigerated  train  and  truck   transportation  has made fresh fish more widely available inland. [ citation needed ] 
 Long term  preservation  of fish is accomplished in a variety of ways. The oldest and still most widely used techniques are  drying  and  salting .  Desiccation  (complete drying) is commonly used to preserve fish such as  cod . Partial drying and salting is popular for the preservation of fish like  herring  and  mackerel . Fish such as  salmon ,  tuna , and  herring  are cooked and  canned . Most fish are filleted prior to canning, but some small fish (e.g.  sardines ) are only  decapitated  and gutted prior to canning. [ citation needed ]

 Seafood is consumed all over the world; it provides the world's prime source of high-quality  protein : 14–16% of the animal protein consumed worldwide; over one billion people rely on seafood as their primary source of animal protein. [52] [53]  Fish is among the most common  food allergens .
 Since 1960, annual global seafood consumption has more than doubled to over 20 kg per capita. Among top consumers are Korea (78.5 kg per head), Norway (66.6 kg) and Portugal (61.5 kg). [54] 
 The UK  Food Standards Agency  recommends that at least two portions of seafood should be consumed each week, one of which should be oil-rich. There are over 100 different types of seafood available around the coast of the UK.
 Oil-rich fish such as  mackerel  or  herring  are rich in long chain  Omega-3  oils. These oils are found in every cell of the human body, and are required for human biological functions such as brain functionality.
 Whitefish such as haddock and cod are very low in fat and calories which, combined with oily fish rich in  Omega-3  such as  mackerel ,  sardines , fresh  tuna ,  salmon  and  trout , can help to protect against  coronary heart disease , as well as helping to develop strong bones and teeth.
 Shellfish  are particularly rich in  zinc , which is essential for healthy skin and muscles as well as fertility.  Casanova  reputedly ate 50  oysters  a day. [55] [56] 
 
 Texture and taste [ edit ] 
 Over 33,000  species  of fish and many more marine invertebrate species have been described. [57]  Bromophenols, which are produced by marine algae, gives marine animals an odor and taste that is absent from freshwater fish and invertebrates. Also, a chemical substance called dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) that is found in red and green algae is transferred into animals in the marine food chain. When broken down, dimethyl sulfide (DMS) is produced, and is often released during food preparation when fresh fish and shellfish are heated. In small quantities it creates a specific smell one associates with the ocean, but which in larger quantities gives the impression of rotten seaweed and old fish. [58]  Another molecule known as  TMAO  occurs in fishes and give them a distinct smell. It also exists in freshwater species, but becomes more numerous in the cells of an animal the deeper it lives, so that fish from the deeper parts of the ocean has a stronger taste than species who lives in shallow water. [59]  Eggs from seaweed contains sex pheromones called dictyopterenes, which are meant to attract the sperm. These pheromones are also found in edible seaweeds, which contributes to their aroma. [60]  However, only a small number of species are commonly eaten by humans. [ citation needed ]

 Health benefits [ edit ] 
   The  US FDA  recommends moderate consumption of fish as part of a healthy and balanced diet. 
 There is broad scientific consensus that  docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)  and  eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)  found in seafood are beneficial to  neurodevelopment  and cognition, especially at young ages. [62] [63]  The United Nations  Food and Agriculture Organization  has described fish as "nature's super food." [64]  Seafood consumption is associated with improved neurologic development during  pregnancy [65] [66]  and early childhood [67]  and more tenuously linked to reduced mortality from  coronary heart disease . [68] 
 Fish consumption has been associated with a decreased risk of  dementia ,  lung cancer  and  stroke . [69] [70] [71]  A 2020  umbrella review  concluded that fish consumption reduces all-cause mortality, cancer, cardiovascular disease, stroke and other outcomes. The review suggested that two to four servings per week is generally safe. [72]  However, two other recent umbrella reviews have found no statistically significant associations between fish consumption and cancer risks and have cautioned researchers when it comes to interpreting reported associations between fish consumption and cancer risks because the quality of evidence is very low. [73] [74] 
 The parts of fish containing essential fats and micronutrients, often cited as primary health benefits for eating seafood, are frequently discarded in the  developed world . [75]   Micronutrients  including calcium, potassium, selenium, zinc, and iodine are found in their highest concentrations in the head, intestines, bones, and scales. [76] 
 Government recommendations promote moderate consumption of fish. The  US Food and Drug Administration  recommends moderate (4 oz for children and 8 - 12 oz for adults, weekly) consumption of fish as part of a healthy and balanced diet. [77]   The UK National Health Service  gives similar advice, recommending at least 2 portions (about 10 oz) of fish weekly. [78]  The  Chinese National Health Commission  recommends slightly more, advising 10 - 20 oz of fish weekly. [79] 
 
 Health hazards [ edit ] 
 See also:  Health hazards of eating fish  and  Mercury in fish 
   Barracuda  found in Florida are avoided due to a high risk of ciguatera. The same fish found in Belize presents a lesser risk due to the lower prevalence of ciguatera-causing dinoflagellates in the Caribbean. Thus, knowing a fish's origin and life history is essential to determining its health hazards. 
   Organic and inorganic compounds including  methylmercury ,  microplastics , and  polychlorinated biphenyls  (PCBs) can bioaccumulate to dangerous levels in apex predators like  swordfish  and  marlin . 
 There are numerous factors to consider when evaluating health hazards in seafood. These concerns include marine toxins, microbes,  foodborne illness ,  radionuclide contamination , and man-made pollutants. [75]   Shellfish  are among the more common  food allergens . [80]  Most of these dangers can be mitigated or avoided with accurate knowledge of when and where seafood is caught. However, consumers have limited access to relevant and actionable information in this regard and the seafood industry's systemic problems with mislabelling make decisions about what is safe even more fraught. [ citation needed ] 
 Ciguatera fish poisoning  (CFP) is an illness resulting from consuming toxins produced by  dinoflagellates  which bioaccumulate in the liver, roe, head, and intestines of  reef fish . [81]  It is the most common disease associated with seafood consumption and poses the greatest risk to consumers. [75]  The population of plankton which produces these toxins varies significantly over time and location, as seen in  red tides.  Evaluating the risk of ciguatera in any given fish requires specific knowledge of its origin and life history, information which is often inaccurate or unavailable. [82]  While ciguatera is relatively widespread compared to other seafood-related health hazards (up to 50,000 people suffer from ciguatera every year), mortality is very low. [83] 
 Scombroid food poisoning , is also a seafood illness. It is typically caused by from eating fish high in histamine from being stored or processing improperly.
 Fish  and  shellfish  have a natural tendency to concentrate inorganic and organic toxins and pollutants in their bodies, including  methylmercury , a highly toxic organic compound of mercury, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and microplastics. Species of fish that are high on the  food chain , such as  shark ,  swordfish ,  king mackerel ,  albacore tuna , and  tilefish  contain higher concentrations of these bioaccumulants. This is because bioaccumulants are stored in the muscle tissues of fish, and when a predatory fish eats another fish, it assumes the entire body burden of bioaccumulants in the consumed fish. Thus species that are high on the  food chain  amass body burdens of bioaccumulants that can be ten times higher than the species they consume. This process is called  biomagnification . [ citation needed ] 
 Man-made disasters can cause localised hazards in seafood which may spread widely via piscine food chains. The first occurrence of widespread  mercury poisoning  in humans occurred this way in the 1950s in  Minamata ,  Japan . Wastewater from a nearby chemical factory released methylmercury that accumulated in fish which were consumed by humans. Severe mercury poisoning is now known as  Minamata disease . [84] [75]  The 2011  Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant disaster  and 1947 - 1991  Marshall Islands nuclear bomb testing  led to dangerous radionuclide contamination of local sea life which, in the latter case, remained as of 2008. [85] [75] 
 
A widely cited study in  JAMA  which synthesised government and  MEDLINE  reports, and meta-analyses to evaluate risks from methylmercury, dioxins, and polychlorinated biphenyls to cardiovascular health and links between fish consumption and neurologic outcomes concluded that:  "The benefits of modest fish consumption (1-2 servings/wk) outweigh the risks among adults and, excepting a few selected fish species, among women of childbearing age. Avoidance of modest fish consumption due to confusion regarding risks and benefits could result in thousands of excess CHD [congenital heart disease] deaths annually and suboptimal neurodevelopment in children." [68]   
 Mislabelling [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Seafood mislabelling 
   Escolar  is sometimes difficult to distinguish from tuna when cooked. Unlike tuna, escolar is associated with  keriorrhea  and severe cramping following consumption. [86]  In many restaurants, most fish labeled as tuna, white tuna, or albacore is mislabeled escolar. [87] [88] 
 Due to the wide array of options in the seafood marketplace, seafood is far more susceptible to mislabeling than terrestrial food. [75]  There are more than 1,700 species of seafood in the United States' consumer marketplace, 80 - 90% of which are imported and less than 1% of which is tested for fraud. [87]  However, more recent research into seafood imports and consumption patterns among consumers in the United States suggests 35%-38% of seafood products are of domestic origin. [89]   consumption suggests Estimates of mislabelled seafood in the United States range from 33% in general up to 86% for particular species. [87] 
 Byzantine  supply chains , frequent bycatch, brand naming, species substitution, and inaccurate ecolabels all contribute to confusion for the consumer. [90]  A 2013 study by  Oceana  found that one third of seafood sampled from the United States was incorrectly labelled. [87]   Snapper  and  tuna  were particularly susceptible to mislabelling, and seafood substitution was the most common type of fraud. Another type of mislabelling is short-weighting, where practices such as overglasing or soaking can misleadingly increase the apparent weight of the fish. [91]  For supermarket shoppers, many seafood products are unrecognisable  fillets . Without sophisticated  DNA testing , there is no foolproof method to identify a fish species without their head, skin, and fins. This creates easy opportunities to substitute cheap products for expensive ones, a form of economic fraud. [92] 
 Beyond financial concerns, significant health risks arise from hidden pollutants and marine toxins in an already fraught marketplace. Seafood fraud has led to widespread  keriorrhea  due to mislabeled escolar, mercury poisoning from products marketed as safe for pregnant women, and hospitalisation and neurological damage due to mislabeled  pufferfish . [88]  For example, a 2014 study published in  PLOS One  found that 15% of  MSC  certified  Patagonian toothfish  originated from uncertified and mercury polluted fisheries. These fishery-stock substitutions had 100% more mercury than their genuine counterparts, "vastly exceeding" limits in Canada, New Zealand, and Australia. [93] 
 
 Sustainability [ edit ] 
 See also:  Overfishing ,  Sustainable seafood , and  Sustainable seafood advisory lists and certification 
 Research into population trends of various species of seafood is pointing to a global collapse of seafood species by 2048. Such a collapse would occur due to pollution and  overfishing , threatening oceanic ecosystems, according to some researchers. [94] 
 A major international scientific study released in November 2006 in the journal  Science  found that about one-third of all fishing stocks worldwide have collapsed (with a collapse being defined as a decline to less than 10% of their maximum observed abundance), and that if current trends continue all fish stocks worldwide will collapse within fifty years. [95]  In July 2009,  Boris Worm  of  Dalhousie University , the author of the November 2006 study in  Science , co-authored an update on the state of the world's fisheries with one of the original study's critics,  Ray Hilborn  of the  University of Washington  at Seattle. The new study found that through good fisheries management techniques even depleted fish stocks can be revived and made commercially viable again. [96]  An analysis published in August 2020 indicates that seafood could theoretically increase sustainably by 36–74% by 2050 compared to current yields and that whether or not these production potentials are realised  sustainably  depends on a number of factors "such as policy reforms, technological innovation and the extent of future shifts in demand". [97] [98] 
 The  FAO  State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture 2004 report estimates that in 2003, of the main fish stocks or groups of resources for which assessment information is available, "approximately one-quarter were  overexploited , depleted or recovering from depletion (16%, 7% and 1% respectively) and needed rebuilding." [99] 
 The  National Fisheries Institute , a trade advocacy group representing the United States seafood industry, disagree. They claim that currently observed declines in fish population are due to natural fluctuations and that enhanced technologies will eventually alleviate whatever impact humanity is having on oceanic life. [100] 
 
 In religion [ edit ] 
 See also:  Kosher seafood 
 For the most part  Islamic dietary laws  allow the eating of seafood, though the  Hanbali  forbid eels, the  Shafi  forbid frogs and crocodiles, and the  Hanafi  forbid  bottom feeders  such as shellfish and  carp . [101]  The  Jewish  laws of  Kashrut  forbid the eating of shellfish and eels. [102]  In the Old Testament, the  Mosaic Covenant  allowed the Israelites to eat  Finfish , but shellfish and eels were  an abomination  and not allowed. [103] 
 In the  New Testament  Luke 24 Jesus' eating of a fish and Jesus telling his disciples where to catch fish, before cooking it for them to eat.  Pescatarianism  was widespread in the  early Church , among both the clergy and laity. [104]  In ancient and medieval times, the  Catholic Church  forbade the practice of eating meat, eggs and dairy products during  Lent .  Thomas Aquinas  argued that these "afford greater pleasure as food [than fish], and greater nourishment to the human body, so that from their consumption there results a greater surplus available for seminal matter, which when abundant becomes a great incentive to lust." [105]  In the United States, the Catholic practice of  abstaining from meat  on Fridays during  Lent  has popularised the Friday  fish fry , [106]  and parishes often sponsor a  fish fry  during Lent. [107]  In predominantly Roman Catholic areas, restaurants may adjust their menus during Lent by adding seafood items to the menu. [108]
