   Grilled   game :  crocodile ,  kudu  and  oryx , in Windhoek, Namibia 
   Location of  Namibia 
 Namibian cuisine  is the cuisine of  Namibia . It is influenced by two primary cultural strands:
 
 Cookery practised by  indigenous people  of Namibia such as the  Himba ,  Herero  and  San  groups 
 Settler cookery introduced during the  colonial  period by people of  German ,  Afrikaner  and  British  descent. 
 
 Indigenous cookery [ edit ] 
   Lamb chops  on a  braai 
 In the precolonial period indigenous cuisine was characterised by the use of a very wide range of  fruits ,  nuts ,  bulbs , leaves and other products gathered from  wild plants  and by the hunting of  wild game . The domestication of cattle in the region about two thousand years ago by  Khoisan  groups enabled the use of  milk  products and the availability of  meat .
 
 Vetkoek —a traditional fried-dough bread 
 Oshikundu —a drink made from fermented millet 
 Colonial cookery [ edit ] 
 Namibia  was settled by  German colonists  during the nineteenth century, and German influence on white Namibian cookery remains very strong. One example of German settler cuisine is  Wiener schnitzel .
 
 Brewing [ edit ] 
 Beer  was brewed by many indigenous tribes in the territory that is now Namibia. The recipes depended on locally available ingredients and were brewed to make for instance sugar beer and  honey beer . The  German brewing tradition  continued in colonial  German South-West Africa . After it quickly proved impractical and expensive to import it from Germany, breweries were established all over the colony. However, when after  World War I  many Germans were deported and an  economic depression  set in, most breweries went out of business. [1] 
 German  lager  beers including Tafel and  Windhoek  lagers are still brewed in the country for domestic consumption and export.
