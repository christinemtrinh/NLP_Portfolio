 Circassian cuisine is an ethnic cuisine, based on the cooking style and traditions of the Circassian people of the North Caucasus. This region lies between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, within European Russia.
 Circassian cuisine consists of many different traditional dishes, varying by season.[1][2] The summer time traditional dishes are mainly dairy products and vegetables.[3] In winter and spring, the traditional dishes mostly consist of flour and meat. Traditional dishes include ficcin, seasoned chicken or turkey with sauce, boiled mutton and beef with a seasoning of sour milk along with salt and crushed garlic.
 Among  the many varieties of cheese in the North Caucasus, Circassian cheese is the  most popular one.
 On holidays, the Adyghe people traditionally make Haliva (хьэлжъо) from toasted millet or wheat flour.
 In the Levant, there is a widely–recognized Circassian dish known as Tajen Alsharkaseiah.[4]
