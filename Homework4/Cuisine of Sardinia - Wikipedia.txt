 The  cuisine of Sardinia  is the traditional cuisine of the island of  Sardinia , and the expression of its culinary art. It is characterised by its own variety, and by the fact of having been enriched through a number of interactions with the other  Mediterranean  cultures while retaining its own identity. Sardinia's food culture is strictly divided into food from the land and food from the sea, reflecting the island's historical vicissitudes and especially its geographic landscapes, spacing from the coastline to the ragged mountains of the interior. The Sardinian cuisine is considered part of the  Mediterranean diet , a nutritional model that was proclaimed by  UNESCO  as an  intangible cultural heritage .
 
 
 Seafood [ edit ] 
   Uncooked Fregula 
 Typical dishes of Cagliari are the  fregula  cun còciula  ("fregula with clams"); the  còciula e cotza a sa schiscionera  ("clams and mussels cooked in a pan"), and then the  burrida a sa casteddaja  (based on dogfish, vinegar and walnuts), the  cassòla , a soup combining various kinds of fish, crustaceans and mollusks;   s'aligusta a sa casteddaja   ("Cagliaritan-style lobster"); the common spaghitus with clams and  butàriga , and the  spaghitus cun arritzonis , that is sea urchin spaghetti with artichoke or wild asparagus. 
 The cuisine typical of the Oristano area and the  Cabras  ponds, but even Bosa, often include eels. From the fish eggs, the mullet botargo is extracted, which can be served alone or used to dress the pasta. Another traditional product is  sa merca , made up of slices of boiled and salted mullet being wrapped in a sack aromitized with a paludal herb, the  zibba  ( obione  in  Italian ). A variety of the  burrida  (dogfish) can also be tasted. 
 Along the  Sulcis  coastline are some of the most ancient tuna fisheries of the Mediterranean. The local cuisine is influenced by Genoa, and is strongly based on bluefin tuna fishing and related products, like botargo, the tuna heart, the  musciame , the  buzzonaglia , the  lattume  and the Tabarchin  cascà , a variety of the  couscous  dressed with vegetables. 
 The cuisine of Alghero reflects the Catalan influence permeating the town, which can be seen from the Catalan way with which the lobster is prepared, that is boiled with tomato, celery and onion and accompanied by a sauce of lemon, olive oil, salt and pepper. 
 Towards Santa Teresa and the Maddalena archipelago, octopus salads are a typical specialty, while in Olbia there are dishes based on mussels and clams. From both the north and the south of the island are the so-called  Ortziadas  or  Bultigghjata , floured and fried sea anemones.

 Wine [ edit ] 
 Several vineyards are present in every corner across the island, from the Campidanese and coastal plains, to the hilly and mountainous highlands. The particular composition of the soil and the sunny climate allow for high quality productions. The long winemaking tradition has its roots in the Nuraghic past, and from then on it did not suffer any interruptions since the island never fell under Arab rule, and thus the Islamic prohibition on alcohol did not affect Sardinia at all; on the contrary, winemaking saw a major increase in the Byzantine and the  Judgedoms period . Today, there are 15  IGT , 19  DOC  and 1 Docg wines on the island.
The Cannonau is a typical sardinian red wine very rich in phenols made from Grenache grapes - perfect for red meats.
 
 Cheese [ edit ] 
 One of the popular cheeses of the area is  casu marzu , a Sardinian sheep's milk cheese that contains live maggots to help assist the fermentation of the cheese.
