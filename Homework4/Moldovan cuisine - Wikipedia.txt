 Moldovan cuisine  is a style of cooking related to the people of  Moldova . It consists mainly of ingredients such as various meats, potatoes, cabbage, and a variety of cereal grains. The local cuisine is very similar to  Romanian , and also draws inspiration and elements from other cuisines in the region, including  Greek ,  Polish ,  Ukrainian , and  Russian , with a great influence left by the  Ottoman cuisine .
 
 
 Background [ edit ] 
 Moldova's fertile soil ( chernozem ) produces plentiful  grapes ,  fruits ,  vegetables ,  grains ,  meat , and  milk  products, all of which have found their uses in the national cuisine. The fertile black soil combined with the use of traditional agricultural methods permits the growth of a wide range of foods in Moldova.
 
 Dishes [ edit ] 
 Perhaps the best-known Moldovan dish is a well-known Romanian dish,  mămăligă  (a  cornmeal  mush or  porridge ). This is a staple  polenta -like food on the Moldovan table, served as an accompaniment to stews and meat dishes or garnished with  cottage cheese ,  sour cream , or  pork rind . Regional specialties include  brânză  (a  brined cheese ) and  friptură  (a  lamb  or  goat  stew). Local wines accompany most meals. [1] 
 Traditional Moldovan dishes combine diverse vegetables, such as  tomatoes ,  bell peppers ,  aubergine ,  cabbage ,  beans ,  onions ,  garlic , and  leeks . Vegetables are used in salads and sauces, and also baked, steamed, pickled (called  murături ), salted, or marinated.
 The various kinds of  borș ( ciorbă )  include a wide range of soups with a characteristic sour taste. These may be meat and vegetable soups, or fish soups, all of which are soured by  borș  (traditionally made from  bran ), or lemon juice.  Chicken soup  with meat, known as  zeamă , is very popular.
 Meat  is traditionally served as an appetizer or first course. Roasted and grilled  pork , beef  meatballs  (known as  pârjoale  and  chiftele ), and steamed  lamb  are common. Meat and  fish  are often marinated and then grilled.
 Traditional holiday dishes include  stuffed cabbage rolls  with minced meat (known in Moldova/Romania as " sarmale ", and in Turkey as " dolma "),  pilaf  (a  rice  dish), pork  jelly ,  noodles , and  chicken , among others. The holiday table is usually decorated with baked items, such as  pastries ,  cakes , rolls, and  buns , with a variety of fillings (such as  cheese ,  fruit ,  vegetables , and  walnuts ), known (also in Romania) as  cozonac ,  pască ,  brânzoaice  ( poale-n brâu ),  sfințișori ,  papanași ,  colaci ,  plăcinte , and  cornulețe .
 In certain areas, the cuisine of various ethnic minorities is predominant. In eastern Moldova, Ukrainians eat  borscht ; in the south, the  Bessarabian Bulgarians  serve the traditional  mangea  (chicken with sauce), while the  Gagauz  prepare  shorpa , a highly seasoned mutton soup; in the  Russian communities ,  pelmeni  (meat-filled dumplings) are popular. Various dishes served at the New Year's Eve table include mostly Russian-influenced dishes such as  shuba  and  salată de boeuf .
 Other very popular dishes include a variant of pierogi called  colțunași , filled with fresh white  cheese  ( colțunași cu brînză ),  meat  ( colțunași cu carne ), or  cherries .

 Non-alcoholic beverages include stewed-fruit  compotes  and  fruit juice . Popular alcoholic beverages are  divin  (Moldovan  brandy ),  beer , and local  wine .
 European  grapes  are used in the wine making. Popular grapes include  Sauvignon ,  Cabernet , and  Muscat . The main domestic Moldovan varieties include  Fetească ,  Rara neagră , and  Busuioacă albă .
 Sparkling wine  has a special place in Moldovan cuisine. The country produces large quantities of classic white and pink sparkling wines, as well as red sparkling wines that were originally introduced in Moldova. The most famous sparkling wines are those made in the  Cricova winery . Well-known brands of Moldovan sparkling wines are  Negru de Purcari , Moldova,  Chişinău ,  Cricova , Muscat spumant, National, Nisporeni, etc. They are made from a wide range of European grape varieties, including  Chardonnay ,  Pinot blanc ,  Pinot gris , Pinot menie,  Sauvignon ,  Aligote , Traminer pink, Muscat blanc,  Cabernet Sauvignon , and  Pinot noir . The local variety  Feteasca Albă , also used in sparkling wines, has been cultivated in Moldova since the times of ancient  Dacia .
