 Sylheti cuisine (Sylheti: ꠍꠤꠟꠐꠤ ꠞꠣꠘꠗꠣꠛꠣꠠꠣ) represents the food culture of Sylhetis. Hatkora is a common fruit and used to cook different dishes with fish and meat. Enriched with Vitamin C and antioxidants, hatkora curry is best eaten with rice.[1] Though Sylhetis are mainly rice and fish eaters, their culinary system is distinctly different to non-Sylhetis.[2] Multicultural people of Barak Valley to Surma valley,[3] and the Sylheti diaspora have influenced the Sylheti food and flavours practiced for ages. Among them, the culinary system of Khasi, Kuki and other tribes are noteworthy.[4] The cuisine of Sylhet has grown up depending on the availability of plants and animals in the region. Mainly indigenous with some variety, food culture is performed among the Sylhetis that received some external influences as well. When the 360 disciples of Shah Jalal arrived in this region, they not only brought their distinct cultures but also brought distinct cooking styles of their own.[5] Which included many meat dishes along with chicken, beef and goat cooked Mughlai, Middle-Eastern, and Northern Indian style. Mughlai Porota, Pilau, Korma, Kalia, Roast, Biriyani and Kofta for curry dishes while Zardah, Firni and Kheer for desserts have been also included.[citation needed]
