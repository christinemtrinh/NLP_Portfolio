 v t e 
 The  Crimean Tatar cuisine  is primarily the cuisine of the  Crimean Tatars , who live on the  Crimean Peninsula . The traditional cuisine of the Crimean Tatars has similarities with that of  Greeks ,  Italians ,  Balkan  peoples,  Nogays , North Caucasians, and  Volga Tatars , although some national dishes and dietary habits vary between different Crimean Tatar regional subgroups; for example,  fish  and  produce  are more popular among  Yaliboylu  and Tat dishes while meat and dairy is more prevalent in Steppe Tatar cuisine. Many Uzbek dishes were incorporated into Crimean Tatar national cuisine during exile in Central Asia since 1944, and these dishes have become prevalent in Crimea since the return. Uzbek  samsa ,  laghman , and  plov  ( pilaf ) are sold in most Tatar roadside cafes in Crimea as national dishes. In turn, some Crimean Tatar dishes, including Chiburekki, have been adopted by peoples outside Crimea, such as in  Turkey  and the  North Caucasus . [1] 
 
 
 Traditional dishes [ edit ] 
 Çiberek  (or  Chiburekki ) is a fried turnover with a filling of ground or minced meat and onions. Made with one round piece of dough folded over the filling in a half-moon shape.
