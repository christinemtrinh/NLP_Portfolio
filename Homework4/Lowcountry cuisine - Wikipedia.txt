 Lowcountry cuisine  is the  cooking  traditionally associated with the  South Carolina Lowcountry  and the Georgia coast. While it shares features with  Southern cooking , its geography, economics, demographics, and culture pushed its culinary identity in a different direction from regions above the  Fall Line .
 
 
 Description [ edit ] 
 With its diversity of seafood from the coastal  estuaries , its concentration of wealth in  Charleston  and  Savannah , and a vibrant  African cuisine  influence, Lowcountry cooking has strong parallels with  New Orleans  and  Cajun cuisine .
 The lowcountry includes the coastal regions of South Carolina and Georgia. There is a difference of opinion as to what exactly the  South Carolina Lowcountry  encompasses. The term is most frequently used to describe the coastal area of  South Carolina  that stretches from  Pawleys Island, South Carolina  to the confluence of the  Savannah River  at the  Georgia  state line. More generous accounts argue that the region extends further north and west, including all of the  Atlantic coastal plain  of  South Carolina  and  Georgia . The geography is a critical factor in distinguishing the region's culinary identity from interior areas of the South.
 The rich estuary system provides an abundance of shrimp, fish, crabs, and oysters that were not available to non-coastal regions prior to refrigeration. The marshlands of South Carolina also proved conducive to growing  rice , and that grain became a major part of the everyday diet.
