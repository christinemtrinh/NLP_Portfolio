 v t e 
 Syrian cuisine  is a  Middle Eastern cuisine  that includes the cooking traditions and practices of  modern Syria  (as opposed to  Greater Syria ), merging the habits of people who settled in  Syria  throughout its history. 
 Syrian cuisine mainly uses  eggplant ,  zucchini ,  garlic , meat (mostly from  lamb and sheep ),  sesame seeds ,  rice ,  chickpeas ,  fava beans ,  lentils ,  cabbage ,  cauliflower ,  vine leaves , pickled  turnips ,  cucumbers ,  tomatoes ,  olive oil ,  lemon juice ,  mint ,  pistachios ,  honey  and fruits.
 At the beginning of the 21st century, selections of appetizers known as  mezze  are customarily served along with  Arabic bread  before the Syrian meal's main course, which is followed by coffee, with  sweet confections  or fruits at will. Many recipes date from at least the 13th century. [1]
