 Maldivian cuisine , also called  Dhivehi cuisine , is the cuisine of the Republic of  Maldives  and of  Minicoy ,  India . The traditional cuisine of  Maldivians  is based on three main items and their derivatives: coconuts, fish and starches.
 
 
 Coconuts [ edit ] 
 The  coconut  is used in the grated form, squeezed to obtain  coconut milk , or as  coconut oil  in dishes that are  deep-fried . The  hunigondi  is the traditional Maldivian implement used to grate the coconut. It is a long low chair with a serrated steel blade at its end. Grated coconut is used in dishes such as  mas huni . [1] 
 The grated coconut may be alternatively soaked in water and squeezed in order to obtain coconut milk ( kaashi kiru ). Coconut milk is an essential ingredient in many Maldivian curries and other dishes. [2] 
 
 Fish [ edit ] 
 The  fish  of choice is mostly  skipjack tuna , either dried or fresh. Other similar fish species that are part of the average Maldivian diet are  little tunny  ( latti ),  yellowfin tuna  ( kanneli ),  frigate tuna  ( raagondi ),  bigeye scad  ( mushimas ),  wahoo  ( kurumas ),  mahi-mahi  ( fiyala ) and  mackerel scad   (rimmas) . These can be eaten boiled or processed.
 Processed tuna ( Maldive fish ) is used as pieces or as shavings. In order to make curries, the raw or the still-soft processed tuna is cut into  1 ⁄ 2 -inch-thick (13 mm) sections. Dry processed tuna is mainly used to make  short eats  called  gulha ,  masroshi , kulhi  bōkiba , kavaabu,  bajiya  (the local version of the Indian  samosa ), and fathafolhi. Mixed with coconut, onions and chili it is an essential Maldivian breakfast item, known  as  mas huni . Unlike Pacific islanders,  Maldivians  do not have a tradition of eating raw fish. [1] 
 The tuna-based thick brown paste known as  rihaakuru  is also an essential item in Maldivian cuisine. [3] 
 
 Starchy items [ edit ] 
 These are  starches  such as  rice , which is eaten boiled or ground into flour, or tubers such as  taro  ( ala ),  sweet potato  ( kattala ), and  cassava  ( dandialuvi ), as well as fruits like  breadfruit  ( bambukeyo ) or  screwpine  ( kashikeyo ). Tubers and breadfruit are eaten boiled. The screwpine fruit is mostly eaten raw after having been cut into thin slices. [1] 
 
 Curries [ edit ] 
 The most important curry in the cuisine of the Maldives is cooked with diced fresh  tuna  and is known as  mas riha .
 Kukulhu riha  ( chicken curry ) is cooked with a different mixture of spices.
 Vegetable curries in the Maldives include those that use  bashi ( eggplant ), tora ( Luffa aegyptiaca ), barabō ( pumpkin ), chichanda ( Trichosanthes cucumerina )  and  muranga  ( Moringa oleifera ), as well as green unripe  bananas  and certain leaves as their main ingredients. Pieces of Maldive fish are normally added to give the vegetable curry a certain flavor. Curries are usually eaten with steamed rice or with  roshi . [1]
