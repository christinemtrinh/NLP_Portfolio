 Lebanese cuisine  is the culinary traditions and practices originating from  Lebanon . It includes an abundance of  whole grains ,  fruits ,  vegetables , fresh  fish  and  seafood .  Poultry  is eaten more often than  red meat , and when red meat is eaten, it is usually  lamb  and  goat meat . Dishes include copious amounts of  garlic  and  olive oil , and dishes are often seasoned with  lemon juice . Chickpeas and  parsley  are also staples of the Lebanese diet. [1] [2] [3] [4] 
 Well-known dishes include  baba ghanouj ,  tabbouleh ,  sfeeha ,  falafel  and  shawarma . [5] [6]  An important component of many Lebanese meals is  hummus , a  chickpea  puree dish, and many dishes are eaten with  flatbread . [7] [8] [9]  Well-known desserts include  baklawa ,  sfouf  and  ka'ak . [10]  Some desserts are specifically prepared on special occasions; for example,  meghli  ( rice pudding  dessert, spiced with  anise ,  caraway , and  cinnamon ) is served to celebrate a newborn baby in the family. [11] [12] 
 Arak  is an  anise -flavoured  liquor , and is the Lebanese national drink, usually served with a traditional convivial Lebanese meal. Another historic and traditional drink is  Lebanese wine . [13] [14] [15] 
 
 
 History [ edit ] 
   Lebanon  (in red) is at the crossroads of the  Mediterranean  basin and the  Arabian  hinterlands,  Western Asia 
 Lebanese cuisine has ancient roots and is part of the  culinary tradition of the Eastern Mediterranean . Many dishes in Lebanese cuisine can be traced back thousands of years to eras of  Phoenician ,  Persian ,  Egyptian ,  Neo-Babylonian ,  Roman ,  Greek ,  Byzantine ,  Arab  and  Ottoman  rule. [16] [17]  In the last 500 years, Lebanese cuisine has been influenced by the different foreign civilizations that held power. From 1516 to 1918, the  Ottoman Turks  controlled Lebanon and introduced a variety of foods that have become staples in the Lebanese diet, such as cooking with  lamb . After the Ottomans were defeated in  World War I  (1914–1918),  France  took control of Lebanon until 1943, when the country achieved its independence. The  French  introduced foods such as  flan ,  caramel custard ,  eclairs ,  french fries  and  croissants . [18] 
 The  Lebanese diaspora  who live worldwide have introduced new ingredients, spices and culinary practices into Lebanese cuisine, keeping the cuisine innovative and renowned both beyond and within its borders. [19] [20]  Chef and writer  Tara Khattar  describes her style of cookery as 'progressive Lebanese cuisine'. [21] 
 
 Overview [ edit ] 
 Most often, foods are grilled, baked or lightly cooked in  olive oil ; butter or cream is rarely used other than in a few desserts. Vegetables are often eaten raw, pickled, or cooked. Like most  Mediterranean  countries, much of what the Lebanese eat is dictated by the seasons and what is available. Lebanese cuisine also varies by region.  South Lebanon  is famous for its  kibbe , the  Beqaa Valley  for its meat pastries (such as  sfiha ) , and  north Lebanon  and Saida ( Sidon ) for its sweets. [22] [23] 
 
 Typical Lebanese dining, with  mezze  and  arak , taken at a restaurant in  Beirut , Lebanon, 1950 
 In  Lebanon , very rarely are drinks served without being accompanied by food. Similar to the  tapas  of  Spain ,  mezeluri  of  Romania  and  aperitivo  of  Italy ,  mezze  is an array of small dishes placed before the guests creating an array of colors, flavors, textures and aromas. [24] [25]  This style of serving food is less a part of family life than it is of entertaining and  cafés .
 Mezze  may be as simple as raw or  pickled vegetables ,  hummus ,  baba ghanouj  and bread, or it may become an entire meal consisting of grilled marinated  seafood , skewered meats and a variety of cooked and raw salads and an arrangement of desserts. The assortments of dishes forming the  mezze  are generally consumed in small bites using a piece of  flatbread . [25] 
 A typical  mezze  will consist of an elaborate variety of 30 or so hot and cold dishes, which may include:
 
 Salads such as  tabbouleh  and  fattoush 
 Dips like  hummus ,  baba ghanoush  and  moutabal 
 Kebbeh ,  kafta  and  falafel  (fried chickpea balls) 
 Some patties such as the  sambusac 
 Stuffed grape leaves  and pickles 
 Roasted nuts, olives and vegetables 
 Condiments like  toum  and  taratour , ideal for spread on  sfiha [25] [26] [27] [28] 
 When dining as a family, the  mezze  typically consists of three or four dishes, but when served in the restaurant, the mezze can range from 20 to 60 dishes, as the variant combinations and dishes involved are plenty. [29]  Family cuisine also offers a range of dishes, such as stews ( yakhneh ) which can be cooked in many forms depending on the ingredients used and are usually served with  meat  and rice. [30] [31] 
 Although simple fresh fruits are often served towards the end of a Lebanese meal, there is also  dessert , such as  baklava  and  coffee .  When sweets are not available, fruits are typically eaten after meals, including figs, oranges and other citrus fruits, apples, grapes, cherries and green plums ( janarek ). [32] [33]  Although  baklava  is the most internationally known dessert, there is a great variety of Lebanese desserts. [34] 
 
 Dishes and ingredients [ edit ] 
 Lebanese dishes are heavily influenced by the multiple civilisations that have existed within the region, which has accumulated together to form the modern Lebanese cuisine we know today. Using fresh, flavourful ingredients and spices, Lebanese cuisine combines  Turkish ,  Arab  and  French  cooking styles. Characteristics include the use of lamb (introduced by the Ottomans), the abundant use of nuts (especially almonds and pine nuts), and dressings made from lemon juice. [35] 
 
 Bread [ edit ] 
 The Lebanese use bread, usually  flatbread , as an integral part of a meal and food is generally not served without it. [36] 
 
   Variants of  manaeesh  and other bread presented in a Lebanese eatery 
 Pita  bread with a pocket, known as  khubz Arabi  (Arab bread), [37]  is widely popular, and may be cut or torn up to dip in various dishes or be stuffed as a sandwich or wrap with ingredients such as  falafel  or  shawarma . 
 Taboon  bread  is traditionally baked in a  taboon  oven  or a  tannur , and is similar to the various  tandoor  breads found in many parts of Asia. [38] 
 Marquq  is prepared much thinner, almost paper thin, and cooked on a metal  saj  or pan. [39] [9] 
 Ka'ak  is a common Lebanese street bread that is usually consumed as a snack. There are many variations of  ka'ak , from being sprinkled with traditional  sesame seeds  to being stuffed with cheese and  za'atar . [40] 
 Manaeesh  (mini-pizza) is traditionally garnished with  cheese  ( kashk , in its Lebanese version),  za'atar , spicy diced tomatoes and may be eaten for breakfast. These are made in many variants in a number of local bakeries or  furns . Some bakeries allow customers to bring their own toppings in order to build their own customized  manaeesh  for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. [41]  Variants include  manakousheh za'atar  (thyme pizza) and  manakousheh jebneh  which has only cheese. [42] [43] 
 Manaeesh  dough can also be eaten with minced meat and onions which is called  lahm bi 'ajin . Mini versions are called  sfeeha . The same dough can be made into a triangular pie called  fatayer , filled with spinach, onions and sumac. 
 Dairy [ edit ] 
Cheese, as well as  yogurt  and eggs, are commonly used in  Lebanon . [ citation needed ]  One of the more recognizable dishes within Lebanon is  labneh . Unlike regular yogurt,  labneh  is strained so as to remove the watery whey, leaving a thicker, creamier consistency. It is spreadable and garnished with  olive oil  and  sea salt . [44]  It is an extremely versatile dish that can be served in a  mezze  platter for either breakfast or dinner. A variant is mixed with garlic. [44]   Ejjeh  is the traditional  omelette  of Lebanon. [45]  It is made with  egg , chopped  parsley  and  scallions . Within Lebanon, people make this omelette with different herbs that are cultivated from their village. [46] [47] The traditional cheeses of Lebanon originate from around the world Kashkaval  cheese originates in  Balkan  cuisine Nabulsi  cheese is named after  Nablus  in Palestine Halloumi  cheese originates in  Cyprus Akkawi  cheese from the city  Akka Shanklish  from  Levantine cuisine Feta  cheese originates in  Balkan cuisine 
 Cheeses [ edit ] 
 Ackawi  (also  akkawi ), is a salty white cheese made from pasteurized  cow's milk  but can also be made with  goat's  or  sheep's milk . [48] 
 Baladi  cheese  has a mild yet rich flavor. It is called the "cheese of the mountains" since it is made in the high mountains by local shepherds in Lebanon. [49] 
 Feta  is used in salads and other dishes, although some cooks will use a milder cheese called  jibtieh baidha  (simply "white cheese"). [50] [51] 
 Halloum  is a semi-hard unripened cheese, perfect for grilling and frying. Along with  akkawi  it is traditionally stored in brine, giving it a strong, salty taste. (Though modern methods have allowed fresher varieties with less salt.) [52] 
 Kashkaval  is a cheese popular in many  Eastern European  countries that has made its way into Lebanese cuisine. It melts very quickly and is practical for pasta, pizza and sandwiches. [53] 
 Nabulsi  is similar to  halloumi , made by boiling fresh  ackawi  cheese in a mixture of spices and seeds which are then fried, grilled or eaten and used in the popular dessert  knafeh , a cheese pastry soaked in a sugar-based syrup. [54] 
 Shanklish  is made from cow's milk, salted, fermented and seasoned with  thyme  and pepper, formed into cheese balls coated in red pepper chilli flakes. [55]

 Daoud bacha  is a meat-based stew, and consists of beef meatballs (also lamb) with cinnamon, parsley, and stuffed with pinenuts in a tomato sauce. [68] 
 Vegetarian [ edit ] 
 Vegetarian cuisine  plays an important role in the cuisine of Lebanon. Being located in  the Levant ,  vegetables  and  herbs  (wild or cultivated) are abundant in the fertile landscape and serve as a main base of the cuisine. [69]  For  Lebanese Christians , including  Catholic  ( Maronites  and  Melkites ) and  Orthodox , fasting from meat is practiced over the Lenten period (from midnight to noon) during  Easter . Where abstention of meat is observed, the food is referred to as  akl aateh  (meaning food "cut" from the diet, such as meat or absent from meat). The particular food that is "cut" varies over different traditions. [70]
