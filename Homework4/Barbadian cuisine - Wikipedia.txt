 Barbadian cuisine , also called  Bajan cuisine , is a mixture of  African ,  Portuguese ,  Indian ,  Irish ,  Creole ,  Indigenous  and  British  background. A typical meal consists of a main dish of meat or fish, normally marinated with a mixture of herbs and spices, hot side dishes, and one or more salads.  The meal is usually served with one or more sauces. [1] 
 The  national dish  of Barbados is  cou-cou  and fried  flying fish  with spicy gravy. [2]  Another traditional meal is pudding and souse, a dish of pickled  pork  with spiced sweet potatoes. [3]  A wide variety of seafood and meats are also available.
