 Cuisine of the Goan Catholic community 
   Fish curry and rice ( Xit kodi ), the staple food of the Goan Catholics 
   Fish  Rechad 
 Goan Catholic Cuisine  is the cuisine of the  Goan Catholic  community and is largely influenced by the  Saraswat ,  Konkani ,  Portuguese ,  South Indian , and  British cuisines . [1]  Due to over 450 years of Portuguese rule, the cuisine of Goan Catholics is dominated by ingredients and techniques of Portuguese cuisine like deep-frying, oven-baking, pork, vinegar, egg-based desserts, alcohol, etc.
 
 
 Non-vegetarian [ edit ] 
   Fried Goan sausages 
 Goan Catholic cuisine has distinct Portuguese influence as can be seen in the  Assado de Porco , a famous pork roast crackling dish served as the centrepiece at wedding dinners, the  Sarapatel  and  Cabidela  (a dish where fresh pig's blood is stirred into the pork delicacy). The curries use a lot of  spices  and  vinegar .  Xit Kodi  (Xit – parboiled or red rice; Kodi – fish curry) forms the  staple food  of the community. Other popular Portuguese influenced delicacies are  Chouriço  (pork  sausage ),  Vindalho ,  Peixe Recheado , and  Xacuti . [2] 
 The  Chamuça  is a Goan derivative of the  samosa , which is usually filled with minced  beef  or minced  pork , and is a well-known snack. [1]  Beef  croquettes  and prawn  rissoles  are common snacks. Sliced roast beef and beef tongue are popular entrees at Goan celebrations. The traditional,  Molho de Peixe  (fish pickle) and  Balchão  (prawn pickle), are originally from  Macau .
 
 Vegetarian and Sweets [ edit ] 
   'Patoleo' are the  pièce de résistance  of the Assumption feast celebration. 
 Patoleo  (sweet rice cakes steamed in turmeric leaves consisting of a filling of coconut and palm jaggery) are prepared on the Feasts of the  Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary  on 15 August ,  Saõ João  ( Nativity of Saint John the Baptist ) on 24 June and  Konsachem fest  ( harvest festival ) which occurs across Goa during the month of August. [3] 
 Pez  (a type of  congee ),  Koiloris  and  Podecho  (pancakes) are popular delicacies. The  Sanna  is another popular delicacy made from soaked rice and coconut toddy.
 
   Sannas 
 Kadio bodio  (tiny sticks made with wheat flour, dipped in sugar syrup or jaggery and dried) are a bestseller at fairs. [4]   Revdyo ,  Tizan ,  Godshem ,  Filhoses  (a stuffed  pancake ) and  Arroz doce  (a Portuguese rice pudding containing eggs) are also popular.  Neureos  are deep-fried turnovers stuffed with dried coconut, nuts, raisins, and sugar.  Kulkul  is a curly concoction of deep-fried egg-enriched sweet wheat dough.  Bolinhas  are small coconut cakes.  Perada  is a guava-based candy.  Batica  is a moist, rich coconut cake.  Maçapão  is  cashewnut  marzipan formed into the shape of fruits and vegetables.  Dôce de grão  is a sweet made using chickpeas and coconut.  Bebinca  is a rich egg-based multi-layered sweet dish, for which Goa is famous.
