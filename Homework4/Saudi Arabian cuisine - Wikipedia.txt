   Kabsa 
 Saudi Arabian cuisine  ( Arabic :  المطبخ العربي السعودي) encompasses the cuisines and foods of  Saudi Arabia . In spite of the existence of many common dishes, Saudi Arabian dishes vary between regions as the culture itself varies. [1]

 Beverages [ edit ] 
 See also:  Arabic coffee 
 Traditional  coffeehouses  (maqha) used to be ubiquitous, but are now being displaced by food-hall-style cafes. According to the Saudi Arabian Cultural Mission, "serving  Gahwah  (Coffee) in Saudi Arabia is a sign of hospitality and generosity". Traditionally, the coffee beans were roasted, cooled and ground in front of the guests using a mortar and pestle. The host would then add  cardamom  pods to the coffee beans during the grinding process. Once the coffee was brewed, it would be poured for the guests. Today, though, gahwah is not prepared in front of the guests; instead it is elegantly served in a  dallah  and poured into small cups called finjan. [2] 
 Yoghurt  is normally made into a drink called  laban [3] 
 Sobia  is a cold drink usually made in the  Hijaz  but now available all over Saudi Arabia, especially during  Ramadan . It is made from a light fermented mixture of  barley / brown bread ,  date palm  sap, herbs and spices. It may be either white or colored depending on the flavor. [4] 
 
 Fast-food and chain restaurants [ edit ] 
 Chain restaurants have been slow to gain ground in Saudi Arabia, yet are steadily becoming a part of the local cuisine. Although chain restaurants only account for 25% of sales in the service industry, chains have seen far more growth than independent players in recent years. [5]   Al Baik , a chain focused on the sale of broasted fried chicken, has led the charge as far as Saudi-owned chains go, and has expanded operations into several neighboring gulf states. [6] 
 
 Islamic dietary laws [ edit ] 
 Islamic dietary laws  forbid the eating of  pork  and the drinking of alcoholic beverages. This law is enforced throughout  Saudi Arabia . According to Islamic law, animals must be butchered in a  halal  way and blessed before they can be eaten.
 According to the Saudi Arabian cultural mission, "guests are served hot coffee and dates as a symbol of generosity and hospitality. The same practice is carried out in the month of Ramadan. Muslims in Saudi Arabia break their fast with dates, water and Arabian coffee. The caffeine in the coffee and the carbohydrates and iron in dates nourishes the fasting person with a lot of energy. This helps them perform the  Tarawih  held in the evenings during  Ramadan ." [2]
