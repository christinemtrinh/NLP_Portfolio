 This article is about the culinary history of the  Indian subcontinent  with  India  in focus prior to the  partition of India  in 1947. For the modern Republic of India, see  Indian cuisine . For  Pakistan  and  Bangladesh  in focus, see  Pakistani cuisine  and  Bangladeshi cuisine . 
 Aspect of history 
 The  history of Indian cuisine  consists of  cuisine from the Indian subcontinent , which is rich and diverse. The diverse climate in the region, ranging from deep tropical to alpine, has also helped considerably broaden the set of ingredients readily available to the many schools of cookery in India. In many cases, food has become a marker of religious and social identity, with varying taboos and preferences (for instance, a segment of the  Jain  population consume no roots or subterranean vegetable; see  Jain vegetarianism ) which has also driven these groups to innovate extensively with the food sources that are deemed acceptable.
 One strong influence over Indian foods is the longstanding  vegetarianism  within sections of  India 's  Hindu  and Jain communities. At 31%, slightly less than a third of Indians are vegetarians. [1]

 After 9000 BCE, a first period of indirect contacts between  Fertile Crescent  and  Indus Valley  (IV) seems to have occurred as a consequence of the  Neolithic Revolution  and the diffusion of agriculture. [note 1]  Around 7000 BCE, agriculture spread from the Fertile Crescent to the Indus Valley, and wheat and barley began to be grown.  Sesame  and  humped cattle  were domesticated in the local farming communities. [2]  Mehrgarh is one of the earliest sites with evidence of farming and herding in  South Asia . [3] [4] [note 2]   Jean-François Jarrige  argues for an independent origin of Mehrgarh who notes "the assumption that farming economy was introduced full-fledged from Near-East to South Asia," [14] [note 3]  and the similarities between Neolithic sites from eastern Mesopotamia and the western Indus valley, which are evidence of a "cultural continuum" between those sites. But given the originality of Mehrgarh, Jarrige concludes that Mehrgarh has an earlier local background and is not a "'backwater' of the Neolithic culture of the Near East". [14] 
 From circa 4500 to 1900 BC the rulers of  Lower Mesopotamia  were  Sumerians  who spoke a non- Indo-European  and non- Semitic  language, may have initially come from India and may have been related to the original  Dravidian  population of India. [32] [33] [34]  This appeared to historian  Henry Hall  as the most probable conclusion, particularly based on the portrayal of Sumerians in their own art and "how very Indian the Sumerians were in type". [32]  Recent genetic analysis of ancient Mesopotamian skeletal DNA tends to confirm a significant association that some of Sumerians might have come from IVC, and it cannot be excluded that among them were people involved in the founding of the  Mesopotamian civilizations . [34] 
 By 3000 BCE,  turmeric ,  cardamom ,  black pepper  and  mustard  were harvested in India. [35] [36] 
 From Around 2350 BCE the evidence for imports from the Indus to  Ur  in  Mesopotamia  have been found, as well as  Clove  heads which are thought to originate from the  Moluccas  in  Maritime Southeast Asia  were found in a 2nd millennium BC site in  Terqa . [37]   Akkadian Empire  records mention timber, carnelian and ivory as being imported from  Meluhha  by Meluhhan ships, Meluhha being generally considered as the Mesopotamian name for the Indus Valley Civilization. [38] [39] [40] 
 
 Vedic and vegetarian Buddhist exchanges with Roman empire and influence on Southeast Asia [ edit ]

 Main articles:  Ayurveda ,  Buddhist vegetarianism ,  Indian Ocean trade ,  Silk Road ,  Indo-Roman trade relations ,  Indian influence on Southeast Asia , and  Indian influence on Filipino cuisine 
 The ancient  Hindu  text  Mahabharata  mentions rice and vegetable cooked together, and the word "pulao" or "pallao" is used to refer to the dish in ancient  Sanskrit   works, such as  Yājñavalkya Smṛti . [41]   Ayurveda , ancient Indian system of wellness, deals with holistic approach to the wellness, and it includes food,  dhyana  {meditation} and  yoga .
 Thai cuisine  was  influenced  by  Indian cuisine  as recorded by the Thai monk  Buddhadasa  Bhikku in his writing ‘India's Benevolence to Thailand’. He wrote that Thai people learned how to use  spices  in their food in various ways from Indians. Thais also obtained the methods of making  herbal medicines  (Ayurveda) from the Indians. Some plants like sarabhi of family  Guttiferae , kanika or  harsinghar , phikun or  Mimusops elengi  and bunnak or the  rose chestnut  etc. were brought from India. [42] 
 Filipino cuisine , found throughout the  Philippines  archipelago, has been  historically influenced by the Indian cuisine . [43]   Atchara  of Philippines originated from the  Indian   achar , which was transmitted to the Philippines via the  acar  of the  Indonesia ,  Malaysia  and  Brunei . [44] [45]  Indian influences can also be noted in rice-based delicacies such as  bibingka  (analogous to the Indonesian  bingka ),  puto , and  puto bumbong , where the latter two are plausibly derived from the  south Indian   puttu , which also has variants throughout  Maritime Southeast Asia  (e.g.  kue putu ,  putu mangkok ). The  kare-kare , more popular in Luzon, on the other hand could trace its origins from the  Seven Years' War  when the  British occupied Manila  for 2 years mostly with  sepoys  (Indian conscripts), who had to improvise Indian dishes given the lack of spices in the Philippines to make  curry . This is said to explain the name and its supposed thick, yellow-to-orange  annatto  and peanut-based sauce, which alludes to a type of curry.

 Later, arrivals from  Arabia ,  Central Asia , [46]  and centuries of trade relations and cultural exchange resulted in a significant influence on each region's cuisines, such as the adoption of the  tandoor  in  Middle East  which had originated in northwestern India. [47] 
 
 Cuisine exchange during European colonial period [ edit ]

 The  Portuguese  and  British  during their rule introduced cooking techniques such as baking, and foods from the  New World  and Europe. The  new-world vegetables  popular in cuisine from the Indian subcontinent include  tomato ,  potato ,  sweet potatoes ,  peanuts ,  squash , and  chilli . Most New world vegetables such as sweet potatoes, potatoes,  Amaranth , peanuts and  cassava  based  Sago  are allowed on Hindu fasting days. Cauliflower was introduced by the British in 1822. [48]  In the late 18th/early 19th century, an autobiography of a Scottish  Robert Lindsay  mentions a  Sylheti  man called Saeed Ullah cooking a curry for Lindsay's family. This is possibly the oldest record of Indian cuisine in the  United Kingdom . [49] [50] 
 
 Factors driving globalisation of Indian cuisine [ edit ] 
 Universal appeal [ edit ] 
 A 2019 research paper by US economist  Joel Waldfogel , based on travel data from  TripAdvisor , affirmed India's  soft power  which ranked Indian cuisine fourth most popular. Italian, Japanese & Chinese food being top 3. Indian cuisine is especially most popular in United Kingdom, South Korea, Thailand, Japan, Germany, France and US. [51]  In another 2019 survey of 25,000 people cross 34 countries, the largest fans of India cuisine who have tried it are the Indians (93%), UK (84%), Singaporeans (77%), Norwagians (75%), Australians (74%), French (71%), Finnish (71%), Malaysians (70%), Indonesians (49%), Vietnamese (44%), Thai (27%), and mainland Chinese (26%). [52] 
 
 Unique molecular taste and richness of spices [ edit ] 
 Washington Post  reported the results of a 2019 study by the researchers at the  Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur , which analysed over 2,000 popular online recipes from  Tarla Dalal 's portal  "TarlaDalal.com"  containing 200 ingredients out of the 381 known globally. Each Indian dish on average contains at least 7 ingredients. Each ingredient have average of over 50 molecular flavor compounds. Data scientists studied the numbers and amount of molecular flavor compounds shared by each ingredient combined in a dish. Western cuisine tend to pair similar molecular flavor compounds, which is why it tastes bland. On the other hand, the secret to Indian cuisine's unique and delicious appeal is that at molecular level the ingredients used in Indian dish share less molecular flavor compounds, which provides contrasting uniquely balanced taste. Indian cuisine does not uses ingredients that overlap in molecular flavor compounds, "we found that average flavor sharing in Indian cuisine was significantly lesser than expected... Each of the spices is uniquely placed in its recipe to shape the flavor sharing pattern with rest of the ingredients." The more overlap two ingredients have in terms of shared molecular flavor compounds, the less likely they are to be used in the same Indian dish. [53] 
 
 Long and globally networked evolution that is widely ranged [ edit ]

 See also:  Indian Ocean trade 
 Indian cuisine reflects an  8,000-year history  of various groups and cultures interacting with the  Indian subcontinent , leading to diversity of flavours and regional cuisines found in modern-day India. Later, trade with  British  and  Portuguese  influence added to the already diverse Indian cuisine. [54] [55] 
 
 Large diversity of fusion and regional variations within Indian cuisine [ edit ] 
 Another reason for the popularity of Indian cuisine is evolution of a large number of distinct diaspora and fusion Indian cuisine such as  Indian Chinese cuisine  (Chindian or Indian and  own cuisine - Cantonese cuisine  fusion), [56] [57] [58]   Malaysian Indian cuisine ,  Indian Singaporean cuisine  (based on Tamil cuisine), [59]   Anglo-Indian cuisine  (developed during the British Raj in India with adoption of western dishes with Indian ingredients). [60] [61] [62] [63] 
 
 Contribution of the Indian diaspora towards promoting Indian cuisine [ edit ]

 In 2019, according to data released by  United Nations , 17.5 million of  overseas Indians  formed the world's largest  diaspora , including 3.4 million in UAE, 2.7 million in USA, and 2.4 million in Saudi Arabia. [64]  Indian migration has spread the culinary traditions of the subcontinent throughout the world. These cuisines have been adapted to local tastes, and have also affected local cuisines.  Curry 's international appeal has been compared to that of  pizza . [65]  Indian tandoor dishes such as  chicken tikka  enjoy widespread popularity. [66] 
 The UK's first Indian restaurant, the  Hindoostanee Coffee House , opened in 1810. [67] [68]  By 2003, there were as many as 10,000 restaurants serving Indian cuisine in  England  and  Wales  alone. According to  Britain 's  Food Standards Agency , the Indian food industry in the United Kingdom is worth 3.2 billion  pounds , accounts for two-thirds of all eating out and serves about 2.5 million customers every week. [69]  A survey by  The Washington Post  in 2007 stated that more than 1,200 Indian food products had been introduced into the  United States  since 2000. [70] 
 Indian cuisine is very popular in  Southeast Asia , due to the strong Hindu and Buddhist cultural influence in the region. Indian cuisine has had considerable influence on Malaysian cooking styles [71]  and also enjoys popularity in  Singapore . [72] [73]  There are numerous North and South Indian restaurants in Singapore, mostly in  Little India . Singapore is also known for  fusion cuisine  combining traditional  Singaporean cuisine  with Indian influences. Fish head curry, for example, is a local creation. Indian influence on  Malay cuisine  dates to the 19th century. [74]  Other cuisines which borrow inspiration from Indian cooking styles include  Cambodian ,  Lao ,  Filipino ,  Vietnamese ,  Indonesian ,  Thai , and  Burmese  cuisines. The spread of vegetarianism in other parts of Asia is often credited to Hindu and Buddhist practices. [75]

 ^   According to  Ahmad Hasan Dani , professor emeritus at  Quaid-e-Azam University ,  Islamabad , the discovery of Mehrgarh "changed the entire concept of the Indus civilisation […] There we have the whole sequence, right from the beginning of settled village life.", ref "Chandler 34–42" 
 
 ^   Excavations at  Bhirrana , Haryana, in India between 2006 and 2009, by archaeologist K.N. Dikshit, provided six artefacts, including "relatively advanced pottery," so-called  Hakra  ware, which were dated at a time bracket between 7380 and 6201 BCE. [5] [6] [7] [8]  These dates compete with Mehrgarh for being the oldest site for cultural remains in the area. [9]  Yet, Dikshit and Mani clarify that this time-bracket concerns only charcoal samples, which were radio-carbon dated at respectively 7570–7180 BCE (sample 2481) and 6689–6201 BCE (sample 2333). [10] [11]  Dikshit further writes that the earliest phase concerns 14 shallow dwelling-pits which "could accommodate about 3–4 people." [12]  According to Dikshit, in the lowest level of these pits wheel-made Hakra Ware was found which was "not well finished," [12]  together with other wares. [13] 
 
 ^   According to Gangal et al. (2014), there is strong archeological and geographical evidence that neolithic farming spread from the Near East into northwest India. [15] [16]  Gangal et al. (2014): [17]  "There are several lines of evidence that support the idea of connection between the Neolithic in the Near East and in the Indian subcontinent. The prehistoric site of Mehrgarh in Baluchistan (modern Pakistan) is the earliest Neolithic site in the northwest Indian subcontinent, dated as early as 8500 BCE.[18] [18] 

Neolithic domesticated crops in Mehrgarh include more than 90% barley and a small amount of wheat. There is good evidence for the local domestication of barley and the zebu cattle at Mehrgarh [19], [19]  [20], [20]  but the wheat varieties are suggested to be of Near-Eastern origin, as the modern distribution of wild varieties of wheat is limited to Northern Levant and Southern Turkey [21]. [21]  A detailed satellite map study of a few archaeological sites in the Baluchistan and Khybar Pakhtunkhwa regions also suggests similarities in early phases of farming with sites in Western Asia [22]. [22]  Pottery prepared by sequential slab construction, circular fire pits filled with burnt pebbles, and large granaries are common to both Mehrgarh and many Mesopotamian sites [23]. [23]  The postures of the skeletal remains in graves at Mehrgarh bear strong resemblance to those at  Ali Kosh  in the Zagros Mountains of southern Iran [19]. [19]  Clay figurines found in Mehrgarh resemble those discovered at  Teppe Zagheh  on the Qazvin plain south of the Elburz range in Iran (the 7th millennium BCE) and  Jeitun  in Turkmenistan (the 6th millennium BCE) [24]. [24]  Strong arguments have been made for the Near-Eastern origin of some domesticated plants and herd animals at Jeitun in Turkmenistan (pp. 225–227 in [25]). [25] The Near East is separated from the Indus Valley by the arid plateaus, ridges and deserts of Iran and Afghanistan, where rainfall agriculture is possible only in the foothills and cul-de-sac valleys [26]. [26]  Nevertheless, this area was not an insurmountable obstacle for the dispersal of the Neolithic. The route south of the Caspian sea is a part of the Silk Road, some sections of which were in use from at least 3,000 BCE, connecting Badakhshan (northeastern Afghanistan and southeastern Tajikistan) with Western Asia, Egypt and India [27]. [27]  Similarly, the section from Badakhshan to the Mesopotamian plains (the  Great Khorasan Road ) was apparently functioning by 4,000 BCE and numerous prehistoric sites are located along it, whose assemblages are dominated by the  Cheshmeh-Ali  (Tehran Plain) ceramic technology, forms and designs [26]. [26]  Striking similarities in figurines and pottery styles, and mud-brick shapes, between widely separated early Neolithic sites in the Zagros Mountains of northwestern Iran (Jarmo and Sarab), the Deh Luran Plain in southwestern Iran (Tappeh Ali Kosh and Chogha Sefid), Susiana (Chogha Bonut and Chogha Mish), the Iranian Central Plateau ( Tappeh-Sang-e Chakhmaq ), and Turkmenistan (Jeitun) suggest a common incipient culture [28]. [28]  The Neolithic dispersal across South Asia plausibly involved migration of the population ([29] [29]  and [25], pp. 231–233). [25]  This possibility is also supported by Y-chromosome and mtDNA analyses [30], [30]  [31]." [31]
