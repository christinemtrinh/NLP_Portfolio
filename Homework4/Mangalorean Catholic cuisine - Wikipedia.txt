   A Fried Fish in  Mangalorean Catholic  style 
   Fish  Roe  Curry in Mangalorean Catholic style 
 The  Mangalorean Catholic Cuisine  is the cuisine of the  Mangalorean Catholic  community.
 Mangalorean Catholics are  Roman Catholics  from  Mangalore  and the rest of the historic  South Canara  area by the southwestern coast of  Carnataca , India. Most Mangalorean Catholics share ancestry with present-day  Goan Catholics , they had migrated to South Canara from  Portuguese Goa  between 1560 and 1763 following their  Christianisation in Goa . The migration continued during the  Portuguese Inquisition in Goa and Bombay-Bassein  and the  Mahratta Invasion of Goa and Bombay . The  culture of Mangalorean Catholics  is a blend of Mangalorean and Goan cultures. After migration, they adopted some aspects the local Mangalorean culture but retained many elements of their  Konkani ways of life .
 
 
 Non-vegetarian cuisine [ edit ] 
   Sanna–Dukra Maas 
 Their curry uses a lot of coconut and curry leaves while ginger, garlic and chilli are also used. Mangalorean Catholic cuisine has distinct Portuguese influence as can be seen in  Laitao , the famous  pork roast  served as the  Pièce de résistance  at wedding dinners, and  Pork  Sorpotel . Fabled cooks like Davidam or Alicebai were called in to help with the repast. Mangalorean Catholics mix pork blood and other parts in most of their pork delicacies as can be seen from  Pork Bafat ,  Cabidela  and  Kalleze un Kiti  (heart and intestines).  Sanna–Dukra Maas  ( Sanna  –  idli  fluffed with  toddy  or yeast;  Dukra Maas  –  Pork ) [1]  and  Unde–Dukra Maas  ( Unde  – leavened  bread ;  Dukra Maas  – Pork) are popular dishes.  Chicken Indaz  is also popular. The traditional  Rosachi kadi  (Ros Curry), a fish curry made with  ros  ( coconut milk ) is quite popular and is served during the  Ros  ( anointing ) ceremony that is held 1 or 2 days before a Mangalorean Catholic wedding. Their fish curry especially their Fish  Roe  Curry, is known for its taste in the whole of coastal India while fried fish in their style is well known. The Sheveo Roce and Pathal Bakri (a variant of  Kori Rotti ) are dry rice flakes dipped in chicken gravy dishes. [2] 
 
 Vegetarian cuisine [ edit ] 
   Kuswar 
 The " Balthazaar Chutney " is a popular condiment. The dish originated when Balthazaar, a Mangalorean Catholic nobleman, was taken prisoner by  Tippu Sultan  in 1784 during the  Captivity of Mangalorean Catholics at Seringapatam . Unable to stomach the indifferent camp food, he offered to make a  chutney  for the captured Mangalorean Catholics.  
 The  Pollu , a type of  Sambhar  with  Galmbi  (powdered  dried fish ) or  Kambulmas  (Dried  Tuna ) is popular. The traditional  Fode  is a popular pickle.  Thail Piao , which means literally vegetables dumped with oil and onions and left to boil on the fire wood is quite popular.  Karamb  (Cucumber salad) and  Foka  (Lady’s finger combined with cashewnuts). The  Appam  (rice balls) and  Panpole  (a type of  pancake ) are popular delicacies made of soaked rice, water and salt. The  Thath Bakri  is a  banana leaf rice  dish made with ground red boiled rice mixed with raw scraped coconut and roasted on a  tava  on a banana leaf. The  Mitais ,  Mandas ,  Ushae ,  Pitae  and  Mani  are well known sweet dishes.
 
   Kuswar 
 Kuswar  is a term often used to mention a set of unique  Christmas  goodies which are part of the cuisine of the Mangalorean Catholic community There are as many as 22 different traditional recipes that form this distinct flavour of Christmas celebration in Mangalore. Neuries are puffs stuffed with plums, nuts, and fried theel (sesame) and sugar.  Kidyo  or  Kulkuls  are curly concoctions dipped in sugar treacle, pathekas are savoury of green  nandarkai  bananas, theel laddus and jaw snapping  Golios . Macaroons is what Manglore is famous for and the subtle flavored rose cookies are a hot favorite. But it is the Rich Plum Cake which takes the better part of a week to make. Candied fruit, plums, currents, raisins are dexterously cut and soaked in rum. Flour sieved and gently warmed in the sun.  Nuts shelled and chopped and the whole family comes together to make the cake.  Jobs are allotted, one to whip up the eggs, while another creams the butter and sugar, cake tins are lined, and a strong pair of arms requisitioned to do the final mixing and stirring.
 Patrode  or  Pathrade , a dish of  colocasia  leaves stuffed with rice,  dal , jaggery, coconut, and spices is also popular. The Mangalorean Catholic version of this steamed delicacy is a slight variation on the  Tuluva  recipe.  More spicy, it is fried in  Meet Mirsang  (salt and chilli),  a red chilli masala, which is a popular condiment used to flavour Mangalorean Catholic dishes.
