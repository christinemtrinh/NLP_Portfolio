Cuban cuisine is largely based on Spanish cuisine with influence from African and other Caribbean cuisines.
Some Cuban recipes share spices and techniques with Spanish, African and Taino cooking, with some Caribbean influence in spice and flavor.
This results in a blend of the several different cultural influences.
A small but noteworthy Chinese influence can also be accounted for, mainly in the Havana area.
There is also some Italian influence.
During colonial times, Cuba was an important port for trade, and the Spanish ancestors of Cubans brought with them the culinary traditions of different parts of Spain.
[1] As a result of the colonization of Cuba by Spain, one of the main influences on the cuisine is from Spain.
[2] Other culinary influences include the Ta√≠no, the indigenous people of Cuba, Africa, from the Africans who were brought to Cuba as slaves, and French, from the French colonists who came to Cuba from Haiti.
[3] Another factor is that Cuba is an island, making seafood something that greatly influences Cuban cuisine.
Another contributing factor to Cuban cuisine is that Cuba is in a tropical climate, which produces fruits and root vegetables that are used in Cuban dishes and meals.
[4] A typical meal consists of rice and beans, cooked together or apart.
When cooked together the recipe is called "congri" or "Moros" or "Moros y Cristianos" (black beans and rice).
If cooked separately it is called "arroz con frijoles" (rice with beans) or "arroz y frijoles" (rice and beans).
[5] A Cuban sandwich (sometimes called a mixto, especially in Cuba[6][7]) is a popular lunch item that grew out of the once-open flow of cigar workers between Cuba and Florida (specifically Key West and the Ybor City neighborhood of Tampa) in the late 19th century and has since spread to other Cuban American communities.
[8][9][10] The sandwich is built on a base of lightly buttered Cuban bread and contains sliced roast pork, thinly sliced Serrano ham, Swiss cheese, dill pickles, and yellow mustard.
In Tampa, Genoa salami[11] is traditionally layered in with the other meats, probably due to influence of Italian immigrants who lived side by side with Cubans and Spaniards in Ybor City.
[12] Tomatoes and lettuce are available additions in many restaurants, but these are considered by traditionalists as an unacceptable Americanization of the sandwich.
[6][13] After assembly, the Cuban sandwich may be pressed in a grooveless panini-type grill called a plancha, which both heats and compresses the contents.
