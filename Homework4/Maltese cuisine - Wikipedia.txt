 Maltese cuisine  reflects  Maltese history ; it shows strong  Italian  influences as well as influences from  Spanish ,  French ,  Provençal , and other  Mediterranean cuisines , with some later British culinary influence. Having to import most of its foodstuffs, being positioned along important trade routes, and having to cater for the resident foreign powers who ruled the islands, opened Maltese cuisine to outside influences. [1]  The traditional Maltese stewed rabbit ( stuffat tal-fenek ) is often identified as the national dish.
 
 
 History [ edit ]

   A typical serving of  kusksu  made with seasonal broad beans 
 Malta's history and geography had an important influence on its cuisine. Having to import most of its foodstuffs, being positioned along important trade routes, and having to cater for the resident foreign powers who ruled the islands, opened Maltese cuisine to outside influences from very early on. Foreign dishes and tastes were absorbed, transformed and adapted. [2]   Italian  (specifically  Sicilian ),  Middle Eastern  and  Arabic  foods exerted a strong influence, but the presence in Malta of the  Knights of St John  and, more recently, the  British  brought elements from further afield.
 The Knights hailed from many European countries, particularly France, Italy and Spain. They brought influences from these countries.  Aljotta , for example, a fish broth with plenty of garlic, herbs, and tomatoes, is the Maltese adaptation of  bouillabaisse . [3]  The Knights' contacts and wealth brought also food from the New World; it has been suggested that Malta may have been one of the first countries in Europe (after Spain) where chocolate was first tasted. [4] 
 The British military presence meant a market of a garrison and their families and, later, mass tourism from the UK. British food products, condiments and sauces like  English mustard ,  Bovril ,  HP Sauce  and  Worcestershire sauce  are still a subtle but pervasive presence in Maltese cooking. Other imports were only nominal. The Maltese word "aljoli" is one of the variations on  aioli  across the Mediterranean; the Maltese version of the sauce is based on herbs, olives, anchovies and olive oil. Similarly, while the Maltese word "taġen" is related to " tajine ", in Maltese the word refers exclusively to a metal frying pan.
 
 Cuisine and identity [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Culture of Malta 
   Rabbit fried with wine and garlic 
 There are a number of junctures in which development in Maltese cuisine related to issues of identity. The most significant example is the traditional Maltese  stuffat tal-fenek  (rabbit stew), often identified as the national dish, quite possibly started off as a form of symbolic resistance to the hunting restrictions imposed by the  Knights of St John . [5]  The dish was to become popular after the lifting of restrictions in the late 18th century (and by which time the indigenous breed had multiplied and prices dropped) and the domestication of rabbits, a technique which could have been imported from France thanks to the French Knights. [6] 
 The popularity of pork and its presence in various dishes could be attributed to Malta being on the edge of the Christian world. Consuming a food which is prohibited in the  Muslim culinary culture  could have been a way of self-identification by distinguishing oneself from the other. In addition to pork dishes (such as grilled pork cuts or stuffed flank) and the exclusive predominance of pork in indigenous Maltese sausages, adding some pork to dishes such as  kawlata  (a vegetable soup) and  ross il-forn  (baked rice) has been common practice in the Maltese vernacular cuisine for centuries. [2] 
 For the  Café Europe  event held during the  Austrian Presidency of the EU  in 2006 the "representative" Maltese pastry chosen was the  maqrut .
 
 Variations [ edit ] 
   Selection of fresh and cured Ġbejniet 
   Gozitan ravjul 
 Regional [ edit ] 
 Further information:  Gozo 
 Despite Malta's small size there are some regional variations. This is especially the case with  Gozo . This is evidenced in some names such as the Gozitan  cheeselet  ( ġbejna t'Għawdex ) and  ftira Għawdxija ,  flatbread  topped or filled with potatoes or  ġbejniet  with eggs, grated cheese, tomatoes, anchovies, olives, ricotta and Maltese sausage as other possible ingredients. [7] 
 Other Gozitan variants include the use of ingredients. Gozitan cheeselets, for example, are used as filling for  ravioli  instead of the usual  ricotta .
 
 Seasonal [ edit ] 
   Figolla – the traditional Easter sweet 
 The strongest seasonal variations are seen in desserts and sweets.  Prinjolata , [8] [9]   kwareżimal ,  karamelli tal-ħarrub ,  ftira tar-Randan ,  figolla  and  qagħaq tal-għasel  are all examples of sweets associated with a particular season.
 Because Catholic fasting during  Lent  involved mostly meats and dairy products, fish such as  Lampuki  were a popular dish during this period as were stewed  snails  ( Maltese :  bebbux ), stuffed  artichokes  ( Maltese :  qaqoċċ mimli ) and  fritters  ( Maltese :  sfineġ ) of  ġbejna , vegetables or fish (particularly  whitebait  and  salted cod ).
 During the  Holy Week  bakers also bake a large  bagel  typically studded with some almonds on top called  qagħqa tal-appostli  ( lit.  apostles' bagel). Usually coinciding with the spring, there are also seasonal variations to certain dishes at the time of  Lent  as in, for example, adding fresh  broad beans  to dishes such as  kusksu  (a vegetable and pasta dish). [10] 
 During the month of November  għadam tal-mejtin  ( lit.  bones of the dead, in  Italian :  ossa dei morti ) are prepared. These are a layer of marzipan sandwiched between sweet pastry and topped with white icing (normal icing and not buttercream icing).
 Qaghaq tal-Ghasel, in English, honey rings, are a traditional Maltese sweet. They consist of a pastry with a stuffing of sorts inside, made into a ring shape, with slits along the ring for the filling to dark filling to ooze out. The filling is traditionally a mixture of  honey ,  molasses ,  aniseed ,  cinnamon  and  cloves , however some people add cocoa powder for a hint of chocolate. Although traditionally made for  Christmas , it became so popular that people started making it all year round, and nowadays many are unaware that it was originally made for Christmas. The cake has a meaning behind it too. The fact that it is a ring means "eternal happiness" and because the filling oozes out, the phrase continues as "overflowing with goodness".
