   Bulgarian  kebab  with  rice 
 Bulgarian cuisine  ( Bulgarian :  българска кухня ,  romanized :  bǎlgarska kuhnja ) is part of the cuisine of  Southeast Europe , sharing characteristics with other  Balkan cuisines . Bulgarian cooking traditions are diverse because of geographical factors such as climatic conditions suitable for a variety of vegetables, herbs, and fruit. Aside from the vast variety of local Bulgarian dishes, Bulgarian cuisine shares a number of dishes with  Persian ,  Turkish , and  Greek cuisine .
 Bulgarian cuisine includes a significant contribution from  Ottoman cuisine , [1] [2]  and therefore shares a number of dishes with  Middle Eastern cuisine , including  moussaka , [3]   gyuvetch ,  kyufte ,  baklava ,  ayran ,  gyuvech , and  shish kebab . [4] [5]  Bulgarian food often incorporates salads as appetizers and is also noted for the prominence of  dairy products ,  wines , and other alcoholic drinks such as  rakia . The cuisine also features a variety of  soups , such as the cold soup  tarator , and pastries, such as the  filo dough -based  banitsa ,  pita , and the various types of  börek .
 Main courses are very typically water-based  stews , either  vegetarian  or with  lamb ,  goat meat ,  veal ,  chicken , or  pork . Deep-frying is not common, but  grilling —especially of different kinds of  sausages —is prominent. Pork is common, often mixed with veal or lamb, although  fish  and chicken are also widely used. While most cattle are bred for milk production rather than meat, veal is popular for grilling meat appetizers ( meze ) and in some main courses. As a substantial exporter of lamb, Bulgaria's own consumption is notable, especially in the spring. [6] 
 Similar to other Balkan cultures, the per-capita consumption of  yogurt  ( Bulgarian :  кисело мляко ,  romanized :  kiselo mlyako ,  lit.   'sour milk') among Bulgarians is traditionally higher than the rest of Europe. The country is notable as the historical namesake for  Lactobacillus bulgaricus , a microorganism chiefly responsible for the local variety of dairy products. [7]   Sirene  ( сирене ), a white brine cheese similar to  feta , is also a popular ingredient used in salads and a variety of pastries.
 Holidays are often observed in conjunction with certain meals. On Christmas Eve, for instance, tradition requires vegetarian stuffed peppers and cabbage leaves  sarmi . New Year's Eve usually involves cabbage dishes, Nikulden (Day of St. Nicholas, December 6) involves fish (usually  carp ), while Gergyovden (Day of St. George, May 6) is typically celebrated with roast lamb.
