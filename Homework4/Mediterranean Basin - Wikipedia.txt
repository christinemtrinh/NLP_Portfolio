   Physical and political map of the Mediterranean Basin 
 In  biogeography , the  Mediterranean Basin  ( / ˌ m ɛ d ɪ t ə ˈ r eɪ n i ə n /   MED -i-tə- RAY -nee-ən ), also known as the  Mediterranean Region  or sometimes  Mediterranea , is the region of lands around the  Mediterranean Sea  that have mostly a  Mediterranean climate , with mild to cool, rainy  winters  and warm to hot, dry  summers , which supports characteristic  Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub  vegetation.
 
 
 Geography [ edit ] 
   Köppen–Geiger -based map of the areas surrounding the Mediterranean Sea. Based on the work of M. C. Peel, B. L. Finlayson and T. A. McMahon at the  University of Melbourne . For a full legend, see  Legend of the Köppen–Geiger climate classification  on the Wikimedia Commons.        Desert climate               Mediterranean climate       Semi-arid climate               Humid subtropical climate       Subarctic climate               Humid continental climate       Tundra 
 The Mediterranean Basin covers portions of three continents:  Europe ,  Africa , and  Asia . It is distinct from the  drainage basin , which extends much further south and north due to major rivers ending in the Mediterranean Sea, such as the  Nile  and  Rhône . Conversely, the Mediterranean Basin includes regions not in the drainage basin. [1] 
 It has a varied and contrasting topography. The Mediterranean Region offers an ever-changing landscape of high mountains, rocky shores, impenetrable scrub, semi-arid steppes, coastal wetlands, sandy beaches and a myriad islands of various shapes and sizes dotted amidst the clear blue sea. Contrary to the classic sandy beach images portrayed in most tourist brochures, the Mediterranean is surprisingly hilly. Mountains can be seen from almost anywhere. [2] 
 By definition, the Mediterranean Basin extends from  Macaronesia  in the west, to the  Levant  in the east, although some places may or may not be included depending on the view, as is the case with Macaronesia: some definitions only include  Madeira  and the  Canary Islands [3]  while others include the whole Macaronesia (with the  Azores  and  Cape Verde ). [4] 
 In Western Asia, it covers the western and southern portions of the peninsula of Anatolia, as far as  Iraq , [5]  but excluding the temperate-climate mountains of central Turkey. It includes the Mediterranean  Levant  at the eastern end of the Mediterranean, bounded on the east and south by the  Syrian  and  Negev  deserts.
 The northern portion of the  Maghreb  region of northwestern Africa has a Mediterranean climate, separated from the  Sahara Desert , which extends across  North Africa , by the  Atlas Mountains . In the eastern Mediterranean the Sahara extends to the southern shore of the Mediterranean, with the exception of the northern fringe of the peninsula of  Cyrenaica  in  Libya , which has a dry Mediterranean climate.
 Europe lies to the north of the Mediterranean. The European portion of the Mediterranean Basin loosely corresponds to  Southern Europe . The three large Southern European peninsulas, the  Iberian Peninsula ,  Italian Peninsula , and the  Balkan Peninsula , extend into and comprise much of the Mediterranean-climate zone. A system of folded mountains, including the  Pyrenees  dividing  Spain  from  France , the  Alps  dividing  Italy  from  Central Europe , the  Dinaric Alps  along the eastern  Adriatic , and the  Balkan  and  Rila - Rhodope  mountains of the Balkan Peninsula divide the Mediterranean from the temperate climate regions of  Western ,  Northwestern  or  Northern Europe ,  Central Europe , and  Eastern Europe .
 
 Geology and paleoclimatology [ edit ] 
 The Mediterranean Basin was shaped by the ancient collision of the northward-moving African–Arabian continent with the stable Eurasian continent. As Africa–Arabia moved north, it closed the former  Tethys Sea , which formerly separated Eurasia from the ancient super continent of  Gondwana , of which Africa was part. At about the same time, 170 mya in the  Jurassic  period, a small Neotethys ocean basin formed shortly before the Tethys Sea was closed at the eastern end. The collision pushed up a vast system of mountains, extending from the  Pyrenees  in Spain to the  Zagros Mountains  in  Iran . This episode of mountain building, known as the  Alpine orogeny , occurred mostly during the  Oligocene  (34 to 23 million years ago ( mya )) and  Miocene  (23 to 5.3 mya) epochs. The Neotethys became larger during these collisions and associated folding and subduction.
 About 6 mya during the late Miocene, the Mediterranean was closed at its western end by drifting Africa, which caused the entire sea to evaporate. There followed several (debated) episodes of sea drawdown and re-flooding known as the  Messinian Salinity Crisis ,  which ended when the Atlantic last re-flooded the basin at the end of the Miocene. [6]  Recent research has suggested that a desiccation-flooding cycle may have repeated several times  [7] [8]  during the last 630,000 years of the Miocene epoch, which could explain several events of large amounts of salt deposition. Recent studies, however, show that repeated desiccation and re-flooding is unlikely from a  geodynamic  point of view. [9] [10] 
 The end of the Miocene also marked a change in the Mediterranean Basin's climate. Fossil evidence shows that the Mediterranean Basin had a relatively humid subtropical climate with summer rainfall during the Miocene, which supported  laurel forests . The shift to a Mediterranean climate occurred within the last 3.2–2.8 million years, during the  Pliocene  epoch, as summer rainfall decreased. The subtropical laurel forests retreated, although they persisted on the islands of  Macaronesia  off the Atlantic coast of Iberia and North Africa, and the present Mediterranean vegetation evolved, dominated by coniferous trees and  sclerophyllous  trees and shrubs, with small, hard, waxy leaves that prevent moisture loss in the dry summers. Much of these forests and shrublands have been altered beyond recognition by thousands of years of human habitation. There are now very few relatively intact natural areas in what was once a heavily wooded region.

 Phytogeographically , the Mediterranean Basin together with the nearby Atlantic coast, the  Mediterranean woodlands and forests  and  Mediterranean dry woodlands and steppe  of  North Africa , the  Black Sea  coast of northeastern  Anatolia , the southern coast of  Crimea  between  Sevastopol  and  Feodosiya  in  Ukraine  and the Black Sea coast between  Anapa  and  Tuapse  in  Russia  forms the  Mediterranean Floristic Region , which belongs to the Tethyan Subkingdom of the  Boreal Kingdom  and is enclosed between the  Circumboreal ,  Irano-Turanian ,  Saharo-Arabian  and  Macaronesian   floristic regions .
 The Mediterranean Region was first proposed by German botanist  August Grisebach  in the late 19th century.
 The  monotypic   Drosophyllaceae , recently segregated from  Droseraceae , is the only plant family  endemic  to the region. Among the endemic plant genera are: [ dubious    –  discuss ]

 The genera  Aubrieta ,  Sesamoides ,  Cynara ,  Dracunculus ,  Arisarum  and  Biarum  are nearly endemic. Among the endemic species prominent in the Mediterranean vegetation are the  Aleppo pine ,  stone pine ,  Mediterranean cypress ,  bay laurel ,  Oriental sweetgum ,  holm oak ,  kermes oak ,  strawberry tree ,  Greek strawberry tree ,  mastic ,  terebinth ,  common myrtle ,  oleander ,  Acanthus mollis  and  Vitex agnus-castus . Moreover, many plant  taxa  are shared with one of the four neighboring floristic regions only. According to different versions of  Armen Takhtajan 's delineation, the Mediterranean Region is further subdivided into seven to nine  floristic provinces : Southwestern Mediterranean (or Southern Moroccan and Southwestern Mediterranean), Ibero-Balearian (or Iberian and Balearian), Liguro-Tyrrhenian, Adriatic,  East Mediterranean , South Mediterranean and Crimeo-Novorossiysk. [11] 
 The Mediterranean Basin is the largest of the world's five  Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub  regions. It is home to a number of plant communities, which vary with rainfall, elevation, latitude, and soil.
 
 Scrublands  occur in the driest areas, especially areas near the seacoast where wind and salt spray are frequent. Low, soft-leaved scrublands around the Mediterranean are known as  garrigar  in  Catalan ,  garrigue  in  French ,  phrygana  in  Greek ,  tomillares  in  Spanish , and  batha  in  Hebrew . 
 Shrublands  are dense thickets of evergreen sclerophyll  shrubs  and small trees and are the most common plant community around the Mediterranean. Mediterranean shrublands are known as  màquia  in Catalan,  macchia  in  Italian ,  maquis  in French, and " matorral " in Spanish. In some places, shrublands are the mature vegetation type, and in other places the result of the degradation of former forest or woodland by logging or  overgrazing , or disturbance by major fires. 
 Savannas  and  grasslands  occur around the Mediterranean, usually dominated by annual  grasses . 
 Woodlands  are usually dominated by  oak  and  pine , mixed with other sclerophyll and coniferous trees. 
 Forests  are distinct from woodlands in having a closed canopy, and occur in the areas of highest rainfall and in  riparian  zones along rivers and streams where they receive summer water. Mediterranean forests are generally composed of evergreen trees, predominantly oak and pine. At higher elevations Mediterranean forests transition to mixed broadleaf and tall conifer forests similar to temperate zone forests. 
 The Mediterranean Basin is home to considerable  biodiversity , including 22,500  endemic   vascular plant   species .  Conservation International  designates the region as a  biodiversity hotspot , because of its rich biodiversity and its threatened status. The Mediterranean Basin has an area of 2,085,292 km 2 , of which only 98,009 km 2  remains undisturbed.
 Endangered  mammals  of the Mediterranean Basin include the  Mediterranean monk seal , the  Barbary macaque , and the  Iberian lynx .

 History [ edit ] 
 Main article:  History of the Mediterranean region 
 Neanderthals  inhabited western Asia and the non-glaciated portions of Europe starting about 230,000 years ago. Modern humans  moved  into western Asia from Africa less than 100,000 years ago. Modern humans, known as  Cro-Magnons , moved into Europe approximately 50–40,000 years ago.
 The most recent glacial period, the  Wisconsin glaciation , reached its  maximum extent  approximately 21,000 years ago, and ended approximately 12,000 years ago. A warm period, known as the  Holocene climatic optimum , followed the ice age.
 Food crops, including  wheat ,  chickpeas , and  olives , along with  sheep  and  goats , were  domesticated  in the eastern Mediterranean in the  9th millennium BCE , which allowed for the  establishment of agricultural settlements . Near Eastern crops spread to southeastern Europe in the  7th millennium BCE .  Poppy  and  oats  were domesticated in Europe from the 6th to the 3rd millennium BCE. Agricultural settlements spread around the Mediterranean Basin.  Megaliths  were constructed in Europe from 4500 – 1500 BCE.
 A strengthening of the summer  monsoon  9000–7000 years ago increased rainfall across the  Sahara , which became a  grassland , with lakes, rivers, and wetlands. After a period of climatic instability, the Sahara settled into a desert state by the  4th millennium BCE .
 
 Historiography [ edit ] 
 One of the earliest modern studies of the Mediterranean was  Fernand Braudel 's  La Méditerranéee et le monde méditerranéen à l époque de Philippe II  (The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II), published in 1949.  S.D. Goitein 's multivolume study of the  Cairo Geniza  documents was another important contribution in the area of Mediterranean Jewish culture. [12] 
 
 Agriculture [ edit ] 
 Further information:  Mediterranean cuisine 
 Wheat  is the dominant grain grown around the Mediterranean Basin.  Pulses  and  vegetables  are also grown. The characteristic tree crop is the  olive .  Figs  are another important fruit tree, and  citrus , especially  lemons , are grown where irrigation is present.  Grapes  are an important  vine  crop, grown for fruit and to make  wine .  Rice  and summer vegetables are grown in irrigated areas.
