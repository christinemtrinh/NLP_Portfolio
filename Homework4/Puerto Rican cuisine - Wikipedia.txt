 Puerto Rican cuisine  has its roots in the cooking traditions and practices of  Europe  (mostly  Spain ),  Africa  and the native  Taínos .
 
 
 History [ edit ] 
   Cocina criolla  can be traced back to African, Taino and Spanish inhabitants of the island. 
 Puerto Rican cuisine has been influenced by an array of cultures including Taino Arawak, Spanish, and African. [4]  Although Puerto Rican cooking is somewhat similar to both  Spanish  and other Latin American cuisine, it reflects a unique blend of influences, using indigenous seasonings and ingredients. Locals call their cuisine  cocina criolla . By the end of the nineteenth century, the traditional Puerto Rican cuisine was well established. By 1848 the first restaurant,  La Mallorquina , opened in  Old San Juan . [5]   El Cocinero Puerto-Riqueño o Formulario , the island's first cookbook, was published in 1849. [6] 
 
 Taíno influence [ edit ]

 See:  Native American cuisine 
 From the diet of the  Taíno  (culturally related with the  Maya  and  Carib  peoples of Central America and the  Caribbean ) and Arawak people come many tropical roots and tubers (collectively called viandas) like  yautía  ( Xanthosoma ) and especially  yuca .  Viandas  are starchy  root vegetables , including   yuca ,  ñame ,  yautía ,  batata ,  malanga , and the Puerto Rican  apio , all locally grown in the mountain regions of the Island. [7] 
 
 Spanish/European influence [ edit ] 
   Puerto Rican cuisine has several recipes for  flan 
 See:  Spanish cuisine 
 
 Arroz con dulce  – In Puerto Rico rice pudding is made with rice, sugar, coconut milk, milk, clove, cinnamon, ginger, star anise, rum, and raisins. There are other variations that include purees added such as squash, sweet plantains, batata, yuca, and ripe breadfruit. Cream cheese and pistachios are popular and a rice pudding made with additional egg, lemon peel, and cream cooked just like  crème brûlée . The first written record known to exist about this dish dates 1859 but historians can trace it as far back as the 16th century. [8] 
 Flan  – A milk and caramel custard very popular throughout Puerto Rico. There are several ways to make this dish. Some are unique to Puerto Rico, such as breadfruit and sesame seeds. Coconut [9]  and pumpkin [10]  are two popular varieties. 
 African influence [ edit ] 
 See:  African cuisine 
 Coconuts, coffee (brought by the Arabs and Corsos to  Yauco  from  Kafa , Ethiopia),  okra ,  taro  (malanga),  tamarind ,  yams  (ñame),  sesame seeds ,  gandules  ( pigeon peas ), plantains, many varieties of  bananas , other root vegetables and  Guinea hen , all came to Puerto Rico from, or at least through, Africa. African slaves also introduced the deep-frying of food, such as cuchifritos. [11] 
 
 Regional [ edit ] 
 Arecibo [ edit ] 
 Arecibo  is the biggest municipality in Puerto Rico by area and is located on the northern coast. In the  Río Grande de Arecibo ,  whitebait  called  cetí  is caught. [12] 
 
 Basic ingredients [ edit ] 
 Seafood and shellfish [ edit ]

 On certain coastal towns of the island, such as Luquillo, Fajardo, and Cabo Rojo, seafood is quite popular. 
 
 Cetí  – A type of  whitebait  found in Arecibo. [13] 
 Chillo  – Red snapper is a favorite among the locals. [14] 
 Seasoning blends [ edit ] 
 Traditional cooking on the island uses more fresh and local ingredients such as citrus to make  mojo  and  mojito isleño  and especially fresh herbs, vegetables and peppers to make  recaíto  and  sofrito . [15] 
 The base of many Puerto Rican main dishes involves  sofrito , similar to the  mirepoix  of  French  cooking, or the "trinity" of  Creole  cooking. A proper  sofrito  is a sauté of freshly ground garlic, tomatoes, onions,  recao/culantro ,  cilantro , red peppers, cachucha and  cubanelle  peppers. Sofrito is traditionally cooked with olive oil or annatto oil, tocino (bacon), salted pork and cured ham. A mix of stuffed olives and capers called  alcaparrado  are usually added with spices such as bay leaf, sazón and adobo. [16] 
 
 Puerto Rican dishes [ edit ] 
   Arroz con  gandules, widely regarded as Puerto Rico's main national dish 
 Although Puerto Rican diets can vary greatly from day to day, there are some markedly similar patterns to daily meals. Dinners almost invariably include a meat, and rice and beans. [4] 
 
 Thanksgiving dishes [ edit ] 
 Most American dishes have been adopted for this special day. Side dishes such as  cornbread , roasted yams, mashed potatoes with gravy, hard  apple cider , and cranberry sauce are a part of a Puerto Rican Thanksgiving menu. [ citation needed ] 
 
 Dulce  –  The fusion of American mainland and Puerto Rican food can be clearly seen in Thanksgiving desserts. Puerto Rican desserts use the same traditional ingredients as American holiday desserts including pumpkin, yams, and sweet potatoes. Classic sweets are infused with sweet  viandas .  Flan de calabasas  (squash flan),  Tortitas de Calabaza  (pumpkin tarts),  Cazuela  (a pie made with pumpkin, sweet potato, coconut, and sometimes carrots),  Barriguitas de Vieja  (deep-fried sweet pumpkin fritters made with coconut milk and spices),  Cheese cake  with tropical fruit,  Buñuelos de Calabasas o platáno  (pumpkin or sweet plantains doughnuts), and  Budín de Pan y calabasas  (bread pudding made from squash bread). [17] 
 Christmas dishes [ edit ] 
   Pasteles  are a favorite staple during the Christmas festivities 
 Puerto Rican culture can be seen and felt all year-round, but it is on its greatest display during Christmas when people celebrate the traditional  aguinaldo  and  parrandas  – Puerto Rico's version of carol singing.  Puerto Rican food is a main part of this celebration.
 
 Pasteles  – For many Puerto Rican families, the quintessential holiday season dish is  pasteles , a soft dough-like mass wrapped in a banana or plantain leaf and boiled, and in the center chopped meat, shellfish, chicken, raisins, spices, capers, olives,  sofrito , and often  garbanzo  beans. Puerto Rican  pasteles  are made from either green bananas or starchy tropical roots. The wrapper in a Puerto Rican  pastel  is a  banana leaf . [18] 
 Tembleque  – Sweets are common in Puerto Rican cuisine. During the holidays, one of the most popular are desserts such as  tembleque . This is a coconut-based dessert pudding. It can be made with 2 cans of coconut milk, ¾ cups of sugar, ¼ teaspoon of kosher salt, ½ cup of cornstarch, 1 pinch of ground cinnamon (for garnish), and toasted coconut (for garnish). [19] 
 Beverages [ edit ] 
   Sorullos from Puerto Rico. 
 Chocolate Caliente  – Hot chocolate made with coco, vanilla, milk, spices, small amount of  edam cheese , and topped with whipped cream. [20] 
 Kiosks [ edit ] 
 Rustic stalls displaying many kinds fritters under heat lamps or behind a glass pane can be spotted in may place in Puerto Rico. Collectively known as  frituras  in Puerto Rico, these snacks are called  cuchifritos  in New York City, but to be strictly correct,  cuchifritos  are the mom-and-pop stores where  frituras  are sold. In Puerto Rico, the name  quiscos  (kiosk) is used to refer to the cuchifrito. [21] [22]  Quioscos are a much-frequented, time-honored, and integral part to a day at the beach and the culinary culture of the island.  Fresh octopus and conch salad are frequently seen.  Much larger kiosks serve hamburgers, local/Caribbean fusion, Thai, Italian, Mexican and even Peruvian food. This mixing of the new cuisine and the classic Puerto Rican food.  Alcoholic beverage are a big part of kiosks with most kiosks having a signature drink.
 
 Bacalaítos  – Bacalaítos are the codfish fritters from Puerto Rico. [23]  They are a staple food at many kiosks. 
 Sorullos  – The cornmeal equivalent of mozzarella sticks, except that they're rather fatter and shorter. They're often made with cheese. 
 Puerto Rican food outside Puerto Rico [ edit ] 
   Cuchifritos  ( carnitas ) in New York 
   Jibarito  and rice in Chicago 
 Cuchifritos  – In New York,  cuchifritos  are quite popular.  Cuchifritos , often known as "Puerto Rican soul food" [ by whom? ]  includes a variety of dishes, including, but not limited to:  morcilla  (blood sausage),  chicharron  (fried pork skin),  patitas  (pork feet),  masitas  (fried porkmeat), and various other parts of the pig prepared in different ways. 
 Jibarito  (Plaintain Sandwich) – In Chicago,  El Jibarito  is a popular dish. [24]  The word  jíbaro  in Puerto Rico means a man from the countryside, especially a small landowner or humble farmer from far up in the mountains. Typically served with Puerto Rican yellow rice,  Jibaritos  consist of a meat along with mayonnaise, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes and onions, all sandwiched between a fried plantain, known as a  canoa  (canoe). In the early 20th century, bread made from wheat (which would have to be imported) was expensive out in the mountain towns of the  Cordillera Central , and  jíbaros  were made from plantains which are still grown there on the steep hillsides. The version introduced to  Chicago  was originally made with  skirt steak , but today it can be found in versions made with chicken, roast pork, ham, shrimp and even the  vegetarian  option  tofu  is available.
