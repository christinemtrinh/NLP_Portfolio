 Cuisine of Chinese Muslims  ( Chinese :  淸眞菜 ;  pinyin :  Qīngzhēn cài ;  lit.  'Ḥalāl cuisine',  Dungan : Чыңжән цаы or  Chinese :  回族菜 ;  pinyin :  Huízú cài ;  lit.  'Hui people's cuisine',  Dungan : Ҳуэйзў цаы) is the cuisine of the  Hui  (ethnic Chinese Muslims) and other Muslims living in China such as  Bonan ,  Dongxiang ,  Salar  and  Uyghurs  as well as  Dungans  of  Central Asia .
 While it does have distinctive dishes like  clear-broth beef noodle soup  and  chuanr ,  Chinese Islamic cuisine typically consists of variations on regionally popular foods that are typical of Han  Chinese cuisine , in particular to make them  halal . Additionally, it borrows ingredients from Middle Eastern, Turkic, and South Asian cuisines, notably the heavy use of mutton and spices. Finally, typical of “northern” Chinese food, Chinese Islamic cuisine almost exclusively uses wheat noodles as the staple, to the near complete exclusion of rice. While these variations are typically minor for each dish, they together add up to create a very distinctive cuisine.

 History [ edit ] 
 Due to the large  Muslim  population in Western China, many Chinese restaurants cater to or are run by Muslims. Northern Chinese Islamic cuisine originated in  China proper . It is heavily influenced by  Beijing cuisine , with nearly all cooking methods identical and differs only in material due to religious restrictions. As a result, northern Islamic cuisine is often included in home Beijing cuisine though seldom in east coast restaurants.
 During the  Yuan dynasty ,  halal  and  kosher  methods of slaughtering animals and preparing food was banned and forbidden by the Mongol emperors, starting with  Genghis Khan  who banned Muslims and Jews from slaughtering their animals their own way and made them follow the Mongol method. [1] [2] 
 
 
 Among all the [subject] alien peoples only the Hui-hui say “we do not eat Mongol food”. [Cinggis Qa’an replied:] “By the aid of heaven we have pacified you; you are our slaves. Yet you do not eat our food or drink. How can this be right?” He thereupon made them eat. “If you slaughter sheep, you will be considered guilty of a crime.” He issued a regulation to that effect ... [In 1279/1280 under  Qubilai ] all the Muslims say: “if someone else slaughters [the animal] we do not eat”. Because the poor people are upset by this, from now on, Musuluman [Muslim] Huihui and Zhuhu [Jewish] Huihui, no matter who kills [the animal] will eat [it] and must cease slaughtering sheep themselves, and cease the rite of circumcision. [3] 
 
 
 Traditionally, there is a distinction between Northern and Southern Chinese Islamic cuisine despite both using  lamb and mutton . Northern Chinese Islamic cuisine relies heavily on beef, but rarely ducks, geese, shrimp or seafood, while southern Islamic cuisine is the reverse. The reason for this difference is due to availability of the ingredients. Oxen have been long used for farming and Chinese governments have frequently strictly prohibited the slaughter of oxen for food. However, due to the geographic proximity of the northern part of China to minority-dominated regions that were not subjected to such restrictions, beef could be easily purchased and transported to Northern China. At the same time, ducks, geese and shrimp are rare in comparison to Southern China due to the arid climate of Northern China.

 A Chinese Islamic restaurant ( Chinese :  淸眞菜館 ;  pinyin :  qīngzhēn càiguǎn ) can be similar to a  Mandarin restaurant  with the exception that there is no  pork  on the menu and the dishes are primarily noodle/soup based.
 In most major eastern cities in China, there are very limited Islamic/Halal restaurants, which are typically run by migrants from Western China (e.g.,  Uyghurs ). They primarily offer inexpensive noodle soups only. These restaurants are typically decorated with Islamic motifs such as pictures of Islamic  rugs  and Arabic writing.
 Another difference is that  lamb and mutton  dishes are more commonly available than in other Chinese restaurants, due to the greater prevalence of these meats in the cuisine of Western Chinese regions. ( Refer to image 1 .)
 Other Muslim ethnic minorities like the  Bonan ,  Dongxiang ,  Salar  and  Tibetan Muslims  have their own cuisines as well. Dongxiang people operate their own restaurants serving their cuisine.
 Many cafeterias (canteens) at Chinese universities have separate sections or dining areas for Muslim students (Hui or Western Chinese minorities), typically labeled "qingzhen." Student ID cards sometimes indicate whether a student is Muslim and will allow access to these dining areas or will allow access on special occasions such as the  Eid  feast following  Ramadan .
 Several Hui restaurants serving Chinese Islamic cuisine exist in  Los Angeles . [4] [5]   San Francisco , despite its huge number of Chinese restaurants, appears to have only one whose cuisine would qualify as halal.
 Many Chinese Hui Muslims who moved from  Yunnan  to  Burma  (Myanmar) are known as  Panthays  operate restaurants and stalls serving Chinese Islamic cuisine such as noodles. Chinese Hui Muslims from Yunnan who moved to  Thailand  are known as  Chin Haw  and they also own restaurants and stalls serving Chinese Islamic food.

 In  Central Asia ,  Dungan people , descendants of Hui, operate restaurants serving Chinese Islamic cuisine which is respectively referred to as  Dungan cuisine  there. They cater to Chinese businessmen. [6]  Chopsticks are used by Dungans. [7]  The cuisine of the Dungan resembles northwestern Chinese cuisine. [8] [9] 
 Most Chinese regard Hui halal food as cleaner than food made by non-Muslims so their restaurants are popular in China. [10]  Hui who migrated to  Northeast China  ( Manchuria ) after the  Chuang Guandong  opened many new inns and restaurants to cater to travelers, which were regarded as clean.
 The  Hui who migrated to Taiwan  operate Qingzhen restaurants and stalls serving Chinese Islamic cuisine in  Taipei  and other big cities. [11] [12] 
 The  Thai  Department of Export Promotion claims that "China's halal food producers are small-scale entrepreneurs whose products have little value added and lack branding and technology to push their goods to international standards" to encourage Thai private sector halal producers to market their products in China. [13] 
 A 1903 started franchise which serves Muslim food is Dong Lai Shun in  Hankou . [14] 
 400 meters have to be kept as a distance from each restaurant serving beef noodles to another of its type if they belong to Hui Muslims, since Hui have a pact between each other in Ningxia,  Gansu  and  Shaanxi . [15] [16] 
 Halal restaurants are checked up upon by clerics from mosques. [17] 
 Halal food manufacture has been sanctioned by the government of the  Ningxia Autonomous Region . [18]

 Lamian [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Lamian 
 Lamian  ( simplified Chinese :  拉面 ;  traditional Chinese :  拉麪 ;  pinyin :  lāmiàn ,  Dungan : Ламян) [19]  is a Chinese dish of hand-made noodles, usually served in a beef or mutton-flavored soup (湯麪, даңмян, tāngmiàn), but sometimes stir-fried (炒麪, Чаомян, chǎomiàn) and served with a tomato-based sauce. Literally, 拉, ла (lā) means to pull or stretch, while 麪, мян (miàn) means noodle. The hand-making process involves taking a lump of dough and repeatedly stretching it to produce a single very long noodle.
 Words that begin with L are not native to Turkic — läghmän is a loanword as stated by Uyghur linguist Abdlikim: It is of Chinese derivation and not originally Uyghur. [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] 
 
 Beef noodle soup [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Beef noodle soup 
 Beef noodle soup  is a  noodle soup  dish composed of stewed  beef , beef broth,  vegetables  and  wheat noodles . It exists in various forms throughout  East  and  Southeast Asia . It was created by the Hui people during the  Qing dynasty  of  China .
 In the west, this food may be served in a small portion as a soup. In China, a large bowl of it is often taken as a whole meal with or without any side dish.
 
 Chuanr [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Chuan (food) 
 Chuanr  ( Chinese : 串儿,  Dungan : Чўанр,  Pinyin : chuànr (shortened from "chuan er"), " kebab "), originating in the  Xinjiang  (新疆) province of China and in recent years has been disseminated throughout the rest of that country, most notably in  Beijing . It is a product of the Chinese Islamic cuisine of the  Uyghur  (维吾尔) people and other  Chinese Muslims . Yang rou chuan or lamb kebabs, is particularly popular.
 
 Suan cai [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Suan cai 
 Suan cai  is a traditional fermented vegetable dish, similar to Korean  kimchi  and German  sauerkraut , used in a variety of ways. It consists of pickled Chinese cabbage. Suan cai is a unique form of pao cai due to the material used and the method of production. Although  suan cai  is not exclusive to Chinese Islamic cuisine, it is used in Chinese Islamic cuisine to top off noodle soups, especially  beef noodle soup .
 
 Nang [ edit ] 
 Nang  (Chinese: 馕, Dungan: Нәң) is a type of round unleavened bread, topped with sesame. It is similar to South and Central Asia  naan .
