 From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 
 
 
 Culinary traditions of Honduras   Pinchos Americanos  are a popular dish in Honduras. 
 Honduran  cuisine  is a fusion of  Mesoamerican  ( Lenca ),  Spanish ,  Caribbean  and  African cuisines . There are also dishes from the  Garifuna people .  Coconut  and coconut milk are featured in both sweet and savory dishes. Regional specialties include  sopa de caracol , fried  fish ,  tamales ,  carne asada  and  baleadas . Other popular dishes include meat roasted with  chismol  and  carne asada , chicken with rice and corn, and fried fish with pickled onions and  jalapeños . In the coastal areas and the  Bay Islands , seafood and some meats are prepared in many ways, including with  coconut  milk.
 
   A Honduran breakfast. 
 Among the soups the Hondurans enjoy are  bean  soup, mondongo soup (tripe soup), seafood soups and  beef  soups. Generally all of these soups are mixed with  plantains ,  yuca , and cabbage, and served with  corn   tortillas .
 Other typical dishes are  montucas  or corn tamales, stuffed tortillas, and tamales wrapped in plantain leaves. Typical Honduran dishes also include an abundant selection of tropical fruits such as  papaya ,  pineapple ,  plum ,  sapote ,  passion fruit , and bananas, which are prepared in many ways while they are still green.
 Common beverages for dinner or lunch include  soft drinks . One  agua fresca  that is very popular in Honduras is  agua de ensalada . This freshly made drink consists of chopped fruit such as apples and various seasonal fruit. Another popular drink is  agua de nance . A popular bottled soft drink is banana-flavored Tropical.
 
 
 Breakfast [ edit ] 
 Hondurans usually have a large, hearty breakfast. It typically consists of fried eggs (whole or scrambled),  refried beans , Honduran salty sour cream ( crema ),  queso fresco , avocado, sweet fried plantains, and  tortillas . It is common for most households to first prepare tortillas, a staple for nearly every dish, which are used throughout the rest of the day.
 Other breakfast favorites include  carne asada  (roasted meat) and Honduran spicy sausages ( chorizo ). A good breakfast will be accompanied with hot, dark—in this case Honduran-grown— coffee . Honduran coffee is renowned for its delicate qualities, being grown on the slopes of the Honduran mountains in rich soils of volcanic origin. A specific brand famous for its flavor comes from the Honduran region of Marcala; others are the  Copán  coffee and the coffee grown in  Ocotepeque . [ citation needed ] 
 Street vendors often sell breakfast  baleadas  made of flour tortillas, refried beans, and  crema  or  queso fresco . Additional toppings include eggs, meat, and even pickled onions. Vendors sell small  tamales  made of sweet yellow corn dough, called  tamalitos de elote , eaten with sour cream; fresh  horchata  and  pozole  is also common.
 Another food that can be eaten for breakfast as a dessert is  rosquillas . Rosquillas can be considered as a Honduran doughnut and are made from corn (masa, cheese and yeast).
 
 Sopa de caracol [ edit ] 
   Sopa de caracol (conch soup) 
 Sopa de caracol  ( conch  soup) is one of the most representative dishes of the Honduran cuisine. This soup was made famous throughout Latin America because of a catchy song from Banda Blanca called "Sopa de Caracol." The conch is cooked in coconut milk and the conch's broth, with spices, yuca ( cassava ), cilantro, and green  bananas  known as  guineo verde . Other varieties including crab, fish or shrimp are known as  sopa marinera .
 
 Sopa de frijoles [ edit ] 
 This traditional soup is made by boiling black or red beans with garlic in water until soft. Once they are soft, the beans are blended, and added to a pot filled with water and with pork bones to serve as the base of the soup. Once the soup base has taken a chocolate color and has boiled enough, the bones are removed, and water is added to the pot, along with the rest of the ingredients, which may include yuca, green plantains, eggs, and many other ingredients. The soup is served with rice and tortillas, and may be accompanied with sour cream, smoked dry cheese, avocados and lemons.
 
 Carneada [ edit ] 
 Carneada is considered one of Honduras' national dishes, known as  plato típico  when served in Honduran restaurants. While it is a type of dish, a  carneada  or  carne asada , like its  Mexican  counterpart, is usually more of a social event with drinks and music centered on a feast of barbecued meat. The cuts of beef are usually marinated in sour orange juice, salt, pepper and spices, and then grilled.
 The meat is usually accompanied by  chimol  salsa (made of chopped tomatoes, onion and cilantro with lemon and spices), roasted plátanos (sweet plantains), spicy chorizos, olanchano cheese, tortillas, and refried mashed beans.
 
 Rice and beans [ edit ] 
   Casamiento , a  rice and beans  dish 
 Rice and beans  is a popular side dish in the Honduran Caribbean coast. It is often called  casamiento  as in El Salvador. The most common beans used in Honduras are red beans ( frijoles cheles ). Typically in Honduras beans are refried and served with green fried bananas ( tajadas ).
 
 Fried Yojoa fish [ edit ] 
   Fried fish from  Lake Yojoa 
 Fried Yojoa fish often has a more savory flavor compared to other types of fish served in the region. Yojoa fish is salted, spiced, and later deep-fried. It is frequently served with pickled red cabbage, pickled onions, and deep-fried sliced plantains ( tajaditas ).
 
 Baleada [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Baleada 
   An open homemade  baleada  with eggs, butter, cheese and beans 
 The  baleada  is one of the most common street foods in Honduras. The basic style is a flour tortilla, folded and filled with refried beans and  queso fresco  or sour cream ( crema ). Roasted meat, avocado, plantains or scrambled eggs may be added. Honduran fast-food chains serve different kinds of  baleadas .
 
 Corn tortillas [ edit ] 
 Corn, or  maíz , is a staple in Honduran cuisine. Eating corn comes to Hondurans as an inheritance of their Maya-Lenca ancestors; the Maya believed corn to be sacred, and that the father gods created men from it.
 Some tortilla-based dishes include  tacos fritos , in which tortillas are filled in with ground meat or chicken and rolled into a flute. The rolled tacos are then deep-fried and served with raw cabbage, hot tomato sauce, cheese and sour cream as toppings.
 Catrachitas  are a common simple snack, made of deep-fried tortilla chips covered with mashed refried beans, cheese and hot sauce. A variant of this snack are  chilindrinas , deep-fried tortilla strips with hot tomato sauce and cheese. It is common in Honduran restaurants to serve an  anafre , a clay pot with melting cheese or sour cream, mashed beans and sometimes chopped  chorizo  heated on top of a clay container with burning charcoal, with fried tortilla chips for dipping.
 Enchiladas : The whole Tortilla is deep fried and served with a variety of toppings. First ground pork meat is placed, next raw chopped cabbage or lettuce, then hot tomato sauce, and a slice of boiled egg.
 Chilaquiles : Tortillas are covered in egg and deep fried. Afterwards placed in a wide container to form a layer of tortilla as a base. Cheese, cooked chicken and hot tomato sauce with spices is then added. Again place another layer of tortillas and continue to do so to make something like a Tortilla Lasagna. Place in the oven and let cook until cheese melts and the tortillas are soft. Served with thick sour cream.
 Tortilla con Quesillo : Two tortillas with quesillo, a melted cheese, in between and then pan fried; served with a tomato sauce. Mashed beans are sometimes also added as a filling with the cheese.
 
 Condiments [ edit ] 
 Encurtido  is used as an appetizer, side dish and condiment, and is a common dish in Honduran cuisine. [1] 
 
 Tegucigalpan cuisine [ edit ] 
 This refers to the cuisine and restaurants of the city of  Tegucigalpa ,  Honduras . Rice, beans, and tortillas are a staple of the Honduran diet, and some would argue there is little difference in quality between the streetside vendors and top restaurants. [2]  The city, like in most other places in Honduras, offers a wide variety of cuisines from not only Honduras but also  Asia ,  India , the  Middle East , and other regions. Tegucigalpa offers everything from street food to gourmet food in five-star restaurants with a candlelit ambiance. [3] [4]  However, according to  Frommer's , "Tegucigalpa's dining scene is considerably more varied when compared to the rest of the country, but lacks the quality and depth of other Latin American cities." [2]
