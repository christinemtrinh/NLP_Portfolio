 Culinary traditions of the Mediterranean area 
 
 
   Bread ,  wine , and  fruit :  The Lunch  by  Diego Velázquez , c. 1617 
 Mediterranean cuisine  is the food and methods of preparation used by the people of the  Mediterranean Basin . The idea of a Mediterranean cuisine originates with the cookery writer  Elizabeth David 's book,  A Book of Mediterranean Food  (1950) and was amplified by other writers working in English. 
 Many writers define the three core elements of the cuisine as the olive,  wheat , and the  grape , yielding  olive oil ,  bread  and  pasta , and  wine ; other writers deny that the widely varied foods of the Mediterranean basin constitute a cuisine at all. A common definition of the geographical area covered, proposed by David, follows the distribution of the  olive tree .
 The region spans a wide variety of cultures with distinct cuisines, in particular (going anticlockwise around the region) the   Maghrebi ,  Egyptian ,  Levantine ,  Ottoman  ( Turkish ),  Greek ,  Italian ,  French  ( Provençal ), and  Spanish , though some authors include additional cuisines.  Portuguese cuisine , in particular, is partly Mediterranean in character.
 The historical connections of the region, as well as the impact of the Mediterranean Sea on  the region's climate  and economy, mean that these cuisines share dishes beyond the core trio of oil, bread, and wine, such as roast lamb or  mutton , meat  stews  with vegetables and tomato (for example, Spanish  andrajos ), vegetable stews (Provençal  ratatouille , Spanish  pisto , Italian  ciambotta ), [1]  and the salted cured fish roe,  bottarga , found across the region. Spirits based on  anise  are drunk in many countries around the Mediterranean.
 The cooking of the area is not to be confused with the  Mediterranean diet , made popular because of the apparent health benefits of a diet rich in olive oil, wheat and other grains,  fruits ,  vegetables , and a certain amount of  seafood , but low in  meat  and  dairy products . Mediterranean cuisine encompasses the ways that these and other ingredients, including meat, are dealt with in the kitchen, whether they are health-giving or not.
 
 
 Geography [ edit ] 
   Elizabeth David  defines the Mediterranean region as that of the Olive,  Olea europaea . [2] [3] 
 Various authors have defined the scope of Mediterranean cooking either by geography or by its core ingredients.
 Elizabeth David , in her  A Book of Mediterranean Food  (1950), defines her scope as "the cooking of the Mediterranean shores" and sketches out the geographical limits: [2] 
 
 from  Gibraltar  to the  Bosphorus , down the  Rhone  Valley, through the great seaports of  Marseilles ,  Barcelona , and  Genoa , across to  Tunis  and  Alexandria , embracing all the Mediterranean islands,  Corsica ,  Sicily ,  Sardinia ,  Crete , the  Cyclades ,  Cyprus  (where the  Byzantine  influence begins to be felt), to the mainland of  Greece  and the much disputed territories of  Syria , the  Lebanon ,  Constantinople , and  Smyrna . [2] 
 Despite this definition, David's book focuses largely on Spain, France, Italy, and Greece. [4] 
 
   "Those blessed lands of sun and sea and olive trees": [2]  a landscape in  Rhodes , in the Eastern Mediterranean 
 She defines this region as coextensive with the range of the  olive tree : "those blessed lands of sun and sea and olive trees". [2]  The olive's natural distribution is limited by  frost  and by availability of water. It is therefore constrained to a more or less narrow zone around the  Mediterranean Sea , except in the  Maghreb  and in the  Iberian Peninsula , where it is distributed more widely, and on the islands of the Mediterranean, where it is widespread. [5] [2] 
 The Tunisian historian Mohamed Yassine Essid similarly defines the region by the olive's presence, along with bread,  wheat , and the  grape   as the "basic products of Mediterranean folk cuisine": [6] 
 
 Mediterranean cuisine is defined by the presence of fundamental elements which are said to play a more important role than others, reflecting a community of beliefs and practices which transcend religions, languages and even societies. The olive tree, the emblematic tree on more than one account, traces the bounds of a frontier of landscapes and lives on either side of which the Mediterranean begins or ends. Above  Montelimar , nicknamed "Gates of Provence", is the limit of the olive. [6] 
 Other authors question that there is any such common core:
 
 The belief in a common core, emerging from a claim to authority over that kernel of "Mediterranean-ness," is what underlies writing describing the culinary Mediterranean, yet it seems that only from far away does a unified Mediterranean exist. The closer one gets to that common core, the less it is visible, until the food of Umbria comes to seem entirely different from the food of Tuscany, and to compare either to the food of Greece would be absurd. The very idea of a Mediterranean ensemble—be it onions and olive oil and tomatoes or some other combination entirely—presupposes not only a shared history but a unified history, an imagined moment in which the Mediterranean presented a single culture that over time has, like a language, split and branched and flowered into the wild variety of contemporary cuisine. [4] 
 Some writers include the cuisines of the eastern  Adriatic  coast of  Dalmatia  –  Albanian ,  Montenegrin , and  Croatian , while most do not mention them. Some writers also include areas not touching the Mediterranean Sea or supporting olive cultivation, including  Serbian ,  Macedonian , and  Portuguese  cuisine. [7] 
 
 Key ingredients [ edit ] 
 Essid identifies the "trinity" of basic ingredients of traditional Mediterranean cuisine as the olive, wheat, and the grape, yielding oil, bread, and wine respectively. [6]  The archaeologist  Colin Renfrew  calls this the "Mediterranean triad". [8] 
 
 Olive [ edit ] 
   Olive  ( Olea europaea ) 
 Main article:  Olive 
 The olive appears to come from the region of  Persia  and  Mesopotamia , at least 6,000 years ago. [9]  It spread from there to nearby areas, and has been cultivated since the early Bronze Age (up to 3,150 BC) in southern  Turkey , the  Levant , and Crete. [10] [11]  The ten countries with the largest harvests (in 2011) are all near the Mediterranean (Portugal being the tenth largest): together, they produce 95% of the world's olives. [12] 
 The olive yields bitter fruits, made edible by curing and  fermentation , and  olive oil . Some 90% of the fruit production (1996) goes into olive oil. [13]  The Mediterranean region accounts for the world's highest consumption of olive oil: in 2014, the highest-consuming country, Greece, used 17 kg [a]  per head; Italy, 12 kg, Spain, 13 kg; the United States for comparison used only 1 kg per head. [14] 
 
 Wheat [ edit ] 
   Wheat  ( Triticum ) 
 Main article:  Wheat 
 Wheat was domesticated in the  Fertile Crescent , in and near the  Levant  some 10,000 years ago. Its ancestors include wild  emmer wheat ; this was  hybridised , harvested and sown to create domestic strains with larger grains, in ears that shatter less readily than wild forms. [15]  It was spread across the Mediterranean region as far as Spain by 5,000 BC. [16] 
 Wheat is a staple food in the Mediterranean region. Wheat  bread  was already critically important in the empire of  Ancient Rome , which included the entire region; at that time, around 2,000 years ago,  North Africa  was the "breadbasket" of the empire. [17] [18]  Other staple wheat-based Mediterranean foods include  pasta  and  semolina  ( wheat middlings ) products such as  couscous  and  bulgur . [19]  In turn, these are made into dishes such as the Greek dessert  galaktoboureko  (milk börek), consisting of filo pastry parcels around a custard made with semolina. [20]  A widespread wheat dish from  Turkey  and the Levant to Iran and India is  halva , a dessert of sweetened semolina with butter, milk, and  pine kernels . [21] 
 
 Grape [ edit ] 
   Grape  ( Vitis vinifera ) 
 Main article:  Grape 
 The grape was domesticated between 7,000 and 4,000 BC between the  Black Sea  and  Persia ; archaeological evidence shows that wine was being made there by 6,000 BC, reaching Greece and Crete in the fifth millennium BC and Spain by the last millennium BC. Winemaking started in Italy in the ninth century BC, and in France around 600 BC. [22] 
 Grapes are mostly grown for making wine and vinegar as basic components of the Mediterranean diet, as well for drying as  raisins  or for eating as  table grapes . Raisins and table grape varieties are chosen for their flavour. [23]  Grape production remains important in the Mediterranean area, with Southern Europe accounting for 21% of the world's harvest. In 2014, Italy produced 6.9 million tonnes (mt) of grapes, Spain 6.2 mt, France 6.2 mt, Turkey 4.2 mt, and Germany 1.2 mt. [24]  Wine production for Southern Europe was 37% of the world total in 2014, with Italy producing 4.8 mt, Spain 4.6 mt, France 4.3 mt, and Germany 0.9 mt. [24] 
 
 History [ edit ] 
 Concept [ edit ] 
   A dish of roast aubergines and peppers (often called by its Provençal name,  ratatouille , in English), as interpreted on the  Aeolian Islands . 
 The concept of a Mediterranean cuisine is very recent, probably dating from the publication of David's  A Book of Mediterranean Food  (1950). [25]  David herself did not use the term, speaking instead of Mediterranean "food", "cookery", or "cooking". [26]  The usefulness of the concept is disputed. Carol Helstosky, author of the book  Food Culture in the Mediterranean  (2009), is among the authors who use "Mediterranean cuisine" interchangeably with "Mediterranean food". In the preface to her book she writes:  [27] 
 
 Mediterranean food is incredibly popular: pasta,  pizza ,  sausage ,  wine ,  gyros , [b]   kebab , and  falafel  can be found just about everywhere. Food experts and cookbook authors adore Mediterranean cuisine ... [27] 
 Essid acknowledges that "geographical differences and the vicissitudes of history" have affected the food of different Mediterranean lands, but nonetheless asserts that: [28] 
 
 Rules for the preparation and consumption of food are common to the lands that border the Mediterranean. They offer both stability, continuity and reproduction of a specific pattern of eating which resists conquest, invasion, colonisation, social change, industrialisation and urbanisation. Consequently, wherever you go, in southern Europe or the lands bordering the southern Mediterranean, you will find a cuisine and gastronomic ritual which is always familiar. [28] 
   One of several Mediterranean cuisines: Spanish kitchen  still life  ( Bodegón de cocina ) by  Cristoforo Munari , c. 1710 
 On the other hand,  Sami Zubaida  argues in his book  Culinary Cultures of the Middle East  (1994) that: [29] 
 
 The idea of the "standard Mediterranean" ... is a modern construction of food writers and publicists in Europe and North America earnestly preaching what is now thought to be a healthy diet to their audiences by invoking a stereotype of the healthy other on the shores of the Mediterranean. Their colleagues in Mediterranean countries are only too willing to perpetuate this myth. The fact of the matter is that the Mediterranean contains varied cultures. [29] 
 The cookery author Clifford A. Wright wrote in 1999: "There really is no such thing as 'Mediterranean cuisine'. At the same time, we seem to know what we mean when we use the expression ..." [30]  Wright argued that David's book itself was largely about specifically  French  Mediterranean food, pointing out that "only 4 percent of her recipes come from North Africa or the Levant", so that the focus was on an aspect of  European cuisine , largely omitting coverage of  Middle Eastern cuisine . [31] 
 Since David's time, a variety of books on Mediterranean cuisine have been written, including Abu Shihab's 2012 book of that name; [32]  Helstosky's 2009 book; books by other cookery writers include S. Rowe's  Purple Citrus and Sweet Perfume: Cuisine of the Eastern Mediterranean  (2011); [33]  and Mari-Pierre Moine's   Mediterranean Cookbook  (2014). [34]  There are many more cookbooks covering specific cuisines in the Mediterranean area, such as B. Santich's  The Original Mediterranean Cuisine: Medieval Recipes for Today  (1995), on Catalan and Italian recipes; [35]  and H. F. Ullman's (2006) on the cooking of Tunisia, [36]  Spain [37]  and Italy, [38]  each one subtitled "Mediterranean Cuisine".
 
 Origins [ edit ] 
   The  haricot beans  used in a Southern French  cassoulet  were  brought to Europe from the Americas . 
 The ingredients of Mediterranean cuisine are to an extent different from those of the cuisine of  Northern Europe , with olive oil instead of  butter , wine instead of  beer . The list of available ingredients has changed over the centuries. One major change was the  introduction of many foods  by the  Arabs to Portugal, Spain  and  Sicily  in the  Middle Ages . [39]  Those foods included aubergines,  spinach ,  sugar cane ,  rice ,  apricots  and  citrus fruits , [40]  creating the distinctive culinary tradition of  Al-Andalus . [41] 
 Another major change was the  arrival of foods from the Americas  in  Early Modern  times (around the sixteenth century), notably the  incorporation of the potato  into Northern European cuisine, [c]  and the eager adoption of the  tomato  into Mediterranean cuisine. The tomato, so central now to that cuisine, was first described in print by  Pietro Andrea Mattioli  in 1544. Similarly, many of the species of  Phaseolus   beans  now used around the Mediterranean, including  P. vulgaris  (the French or haricot bean), were brought back from the Americas by Spanish and Portuguese explorers. [39] [43] [44] [45] 
 
 Cooking [ edit ] 
   Syrian apricot paste "dissolved in water to make a cooling drink" [2] 
 David's introduction to her 1950 book characterises the cooking of the Mediterranean countries as "conditioned naturally by variations in climate and soil and the relative industry or indolence of the inhabitants." [2] 
 David identifies "the ever recurring elements" in the food of this extensive region as olive oil,  saffron ,  garlic , "pungent" local wines, as well as the "aromatic perfume" of herbs, especially  rosemary , wild  marjoram , and  basil , and the bright colours of fresh foods in the markets, " pimentos ,  aubergines ,  tomatoes ,  olives ,  melons ,  figs " and "shiny fish, silver,  vermilion , or tiger-striped". She includes cheeses of "sheep's or goat's milk", " figs  from  Smyrna  on long strings" and "sheets of apricot paste which is dissolved in water to make a cooling drink." [2] 
 With common ingredients including the olive, wheat, and grape; a shared climate; and a long period for cultural exchange, it might be expected that a single, pan-Mediterranean cuisine would have developed. Certain items, such as olive oil, [6]  bread, [6]  wine, [6]  roast lamb or  mutton [46]  (for example, Maghrebi  méchoui , Greek  kleftiko  and  souvlaki , Turkish  shish kebab ),  bottarga , [47] [48]  and stews of meat with vegetables and tomato (such as Spanish  andrajos , French  estouffade à la provençale  [ fr ] , [49]  Italian  ciambotta , Turkish  buğu kebabı ), are indeed found all around the Mediterranean. [50]   Seafood  including  sea bream  and  squid  is eaten, often in stews, stuffed, or fried, in Spanish, French, and Italian dishes. [51]  Despite this, however, the lands bordering the Mediterranean sea have distinct regional cuisines, from the Maghrebi, Levant and Ottoman to the Italian, French, and Spanish. Each of those, in turn, has national and provincial variations. [50] 
 
 
 
 
 
 Certain foods are pan-Mediterranean, such as  bottarga , the salted, cured roe of fish such as the  grey mullet . [47]

 Maghrebi [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Maghreb cuisine 
   Tagines  slow-cooking on a  Moroccan  street 
 Mediterranean Maghrebi cuisine includes the cuisines of   Algeria ,  Libya ,  Morocco , and  Tunisia . One of the most characteristic dishes of the region is  couscous , a steamed, small-grained wheat  semolina , served with a stew. The dish is ancient, mentioned by the Medieval traveller  Ibn Battuta , [52]  and found for example also in the  Western Sicilian cuisine , especially in the province of  Trapani , where it was re-introduced after 1600. [53] 
 One stew that may be served with couscous is the  Moroccan   tagine , a hearty, somewhat dry dish of meat and vegetables, cooked slowly in a pot (called a tagine) with a tall conical lid. Dishes from the  Maghreb  region of North Africa are often coloured and flavoured with the hot spice mixtures  harissa  and  ras el hanout  (containing such spices as cumin, coriander, saffron, cinnamon, cloves, chillies, and paprika). Other characteristic flavourings of the region are preserved  lemons  and dried apricots and raisins. [46] 
 
 Egyptian [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Egyptian cuisine 
   Ful medames  on an  Egyptian  street with bread and pickled vegetables 
 Egyptian cuisine has  ancient roots , with evidence that, for example,  cheese  has been made in Egypt since at least 3,000 BC. [54]   Falafel  are small fried croquettes of bean or  chickpea [d]  flour, currently also eaten across the Levant and the West, but originating in Egypt's Roman era; they are claimed as theirs by  Coptic Christians . [55]   Duqqa  is a dip made of pounded herbs, hazelnuts and spices, eaten with bread. [56] [57]   Kushari  is a  vegan  dish [58]  of rice, lentils and pasta, variously garnished; it began as food for the poor, but has become a national dish. [59] 
 
 Levantine [ edit ] 
   Levantine   tabbouleh 
 Main article:  Levantine cuisine 
 Levantine cuisine is the cooking of the  Levant  (including the Middle Eastern Mediterranean coast, east of Egypt). Among the most distinctive foods of this cuisine are traditional small  meze  dishes such as  tabbouleh ,  hummus , and  baba ghanoush . [60] [61]  Tabbouleh is a dish of  bulgur  cracked wheat with tomatoes, parsley, mint and onion, dressed with olive oil and lemon juice. [62] [63]  Baba ghanoush, sometimes called "poor man's caviar", is a puree of aubergine with olive oil, often mixed with chopped onion, tomato, cumin, garlic, lemon juice, and parsley. The dish is popular across the whole of the Eastern Mediterranean and North Africa. [64] 
 Ful medames , originally from Egypt and still a national dish there, consists of  fava beans  with oil and cumin; it is popular throughout the Levant. [65]  The dish may be ancient: dried beans of  Neolithic  age have been found near  Nazareth . [66] 
 
 Ottoman [ edit ] 
   Ottoman cuisine  and  Turkish cuisine  combine similar elements 
 Main articles:  Ottoman cuisine  and  Turkish cuisine 
 Ottoman cuisine has given rise to the cuisines of modern  Turkey , parts of the  Balkans ,  Cyprus , and  Greece . A distinctive element is the family of small flaky pastries called  börek . These are popular and widespread across the Eastern Mediterranean region, and date as far back as ancient Roman times. Börek are made of thin sheets of  filo  pastry, filled with mixtures such as meat, caramelised onion and sweet peppers. [67] [68] 
 Another widespread [e]  and popular dish is  moussaka , a baked dish of aubergine or potato with various other ingredients: often minced meat and tomatoes, sometimes a layer of  egg custard  or  béchamel sauce  on top. In its Greek variant, well known outside the region, it includes layers of aubergine and minced meat with custard or béchamel sauce on top, but that version is a relatively recent innovation, introduced by the chef  Nikolaos Tselementes  in the 1920s. [70] 
 
 Greek [ edit ] 
   Greek salad 
 Main article:  Greek cuisine 
 Greek  cookery makes wide use of vegetables, olive oil, grains, fish, wine and meat (white and red, including  lamb ,  poultry ,  rabbit  and  pork ). Other important ingredients include olives, cheese, aubergine, courgette, lemon juice, vegetables, herbs, bread and yoghurt. Some more dishes that can be traced back to Ancient Greece are:  lentil   soup ,  fasolada ,  retsina  (white or rosé wine flavoured with pine resin) and  pasteli  (sesame seeds baked with honey); some to the  Hellenistic  and  Roman  periods include:  loukaniko  (dried pork sausage); and  Byzantium :  feta  cheese,  avgotaraho  (bottarga) and  paximadhia  (rusk).  Lakerda  (pickled fish),  mizithra  cheese and desserts like  diples ,  koulourakia ,  moustokouloura  and  melomakarono  also date back to the Byzantine period, while the variety of different  pitas  probably dates back to ancient times. Much of  Greek cuisine  is part of the larger tradition of Ottoman cuisine, the names of the dishes revealing Arabic, Persian or Turkish roots:  moussaka ,  tzatziki ,  yuvarlakia ,  keftes  and so on. Many dishes' names probably entered the Greek vocabulary during Ottoman times, or earlier in contact with the Persians and the Arabs. However, some dishes may be pre-Ottoman, only taking Turkish names later; the historians of food John Ash and  Andrew Dalby , for example, speculate that grape-leaf  dolmadhes  were made by the early  Byzantine period , while  Alan Davidson  traces  trahana  to the ancient Greek  tragos  and  skordalia  to the ancient Athenian  skorothalmi . [71] [72] [73] 
 
 Balkan [ edit ] 
 Further information:  Albanian cuisine ,  Aromanian cuisine ,  Bosnia and Herzegovina ,  Croatian cuisine ,  Montenegrin cuisine , and  Slovenian cuisine 
 David barely mentioned the non-Greek  Balkans , stating only that yoghurt and moussaka are widespread in the region. [4]  Some later cooks like Paula Wolfert give a few recipes from Dalmatia, some being Ottoman. [4] [7] 
 Albena Shkodrova notes that the cuisines of the coastal provinces of  Istria  and  Dalmatia  were influenced by Venice. She adds that cuisines labelled as "Italian" and "Mediterranean" are becoming popular in the Balkans, which she calls "a historical crossroads of Oriental, Mediterranean and Central-European influences". [74] 
 
 Italian [ edit ] 
   Spaghetti alle vongole , a typical  Italian dish  of  pasta  with  clams 
 Main article:  Italian cuisine 
 Mediterranean  Italian cuisine  includes much of Italy outside the  north  and the mountainous inland regions. It is a diverse cuisine, but among its best-known and most characteristic foods are  risotto ,  pizza  in  Neapolitan  and  Sicilian styles , and  pasta  dishes such as  spaghetti . [75] [76] [77] 
 Risotto  is a dish made using Italian short-grain rice, which is both highly absorbent and resistant to turning into a pudding when cooked with  stock  and flavoured with onions and garlic, cooked in butter. [75]  Anna Gosetti della Salda's book of Italian regional cookery lists 37 risotto recipes, 18 of them from the Veneto. Variations among Veneto risottos include additions of fish and white wine; chicken; eel; mushrooms and grated  Parmesan cheese ; quails; small pieces of beef;  courgettes  (zucchini);  clams ;  ragù ; beans;  mussels ;  prawns ;  cuttlefish ; and  asparagus . [78] 
 
   Pizza  with tomatoes and  mozzarella  cheese 
 Pizza , or as David notes "pissaladina or  pissaladière " in Provence (the cuisines of Mediterranean France and Italy having something in common), is a piece of bread  dough  rolled out thin, with a topping which varies from place to place, but is generally much simpler than those in the English-speaking world. [79] [80]  In Naples this is tomato, anchovies and buffalo  mozzarella . In San Remo it is onions cooked in olive oil, with salted  sardines . The Provençal variety uses onions, black olives, and anchovies. [76] 
 Spaghetti  dishes also vary. It may be eaten as David says "simply with olive oil and garlic", without cheese, or with a sauce of "very red and ripe peeled tomatoes", cooked briefly and flavoured with garlic and either basil or parsley. One Sicilian variant includes pieces of bacon, onions fried in fat, garlic, stoned olives, and anchovies, served with olive oil and grated Parmesan cheese. [77] 
 
 French [ edit ] 
   Marseille   bouillabaisse , with the fish served separately after the soup 
 Main articles:  Provencal cuisine  and  Occitan cuisine 
 Mediterranean  French cuisine  includes the cooking styles of  Provence ,  Occitania , and the island of  Corsica . Distinctive dishes that make use of local ingredients include  bouillabaisse  and  salade niçoise . [81] [82] 
 Bouillabaisse is a substantial dish from the French port of  Marseille , capital of Provence. It is a stew for at least eight people, because it should contain many kinds of fish such as  crayfish ,  gurnard ,  weever ,  John Dory ,  monkfish ,  conger eel ,  whiting ,  sea bass , and  crab . These are cooked with Mediterranean vegetables and herbs, namely onions, garlic, tomatoes,  thyme ,  fennel ,  parsley , bay, and  orange peel . [81] [f] 
 Salade niçoise is a colourful  salad  of tomatoes,  tuna , hard-boiled eggs,  Niçoise olives , and  anchovies , dressed with a  vinaigrette . [82] 
 
 Spanish [ edit ] 
   Spanish   paella  with red peppers and  mussels 
 Main article:  Spanish cuisine 
 Spain's varied Mediterranean cuisines includes the cooking of  Andalusia ,  Murcia ,  Catalonia ,  Valencia , and the  Balearic islands . [83]   Paella  is a characteristic Spanish dish, originally from  Valencia , radiating early on to Catalonia and  Murcia  along Spain's Mediterranean coast. It comes in many versions, and may contain a mixture of chicken, pork,  rabbit , or  shellfish , sautéed in  olive oil  in a large shallow pan, with vegetables, and typically  round-grain rice [84]  (often of the local  albufera ,  arròs bomba ,  sénia  varieties or similar) cooked to absorb the water and coloured with  saffron . The dish may be varied with  artichoke hearts ,  peas , sweet peppers,  lima beans ,  string beans , or sausages. [85] 
 
 Portuguese: partly Mediterranean [ edit ] 
   Pasteis de Nata 
 Main article:  Portuguese cuisine 
Portugal lies on the  Atlantic , not the Mediterranean, but it is in the Mediterranean basin, characterised by olive groves and a Mediterranean climate, except on the wetter Atlantic coast. [86] [87]  Its cuisine too is partly Mediterranean, with the usual trio of bread, wine, and olive oil, but also partly Atlantic, with a tradition of fishing and many seafood dishes such as seafood rice ( arroz de Marisco ), clams, squid ( lulas grelhadas ), and  bacalhau , imported salted cod. There are, equally, many meat dishes, using chicken, pork, and rabbit. Other major ingredients are onions, garlic, bay leaves, sweet peppers (pimentão), cloves, and  chouriço  sausage. Portuguese vegetables include the tomatoes common in Mediterranean cuisine, but also kale, carrots, and broad beans. Sweet dishes include  pastéis de nata , custard tarts with cinnamon. The country produces red wines such as  Alentejo . [88] [89] [90] 
 Anise spirits [ edit ]

 French  pastis  and  absinthe [91] 
 Greek  ouzo 
 Italian  sambuca 
 Spanish  anísado 
 Balkan  rakı 
 Levantine  arak 
 Algerian  anisette cristal [92] 
 Mediterranean diet and cuisine [ edit ] 
 Further information:  Mediterranean diet 
 The  Mediterranean diet , popularised in the 1970s, is inspired by the cuisine of parts of Greece and Italy in the early 1960s. [93]  The  American Diabetes Association  writes about "Mediterranean-Style Eating", mentioning "the traditional Mediterranean lifestyle ... of ... eating healthfully ... together among family and friends", and asserting that "Mediterranean cuisine is plant-based", citing the ingredients "whole grains, fruits, vegetables, herbs and spices, beans, nuts, seeds, and olive oil", and stating that most foods "in a Mediterranean diet come from plants". [94] 
 
   Fast food, Turkish style: with increasing wealth, people around the Mediterranean are changing their diet towards more meat (here, fried chicken) and less vegetables. 
 The 1984  Guida all'Italia gastronomica  states that "around 1975, under the impulse of one of those new nutritional directives by which good cooking is too often influenced, the Americans discovered the so-called Mediterranean diet. The name even pleased Italian government officials, who made one modification: changing from  diet —a word which has always seemed punitive and therefore unpleasant—to Mediterranean  cuisine ." [95] 
 
 A changing cuisine [ edit ] 
 Since David wrote about Mediterranean food in 1950, and indeed since dietary researchers showed in the 1950s that people around the Mediterranean had less  coronary heart disease  than the peoples of northern Europe, the traditional Mediterranean ways of life and of eating have changed. Increased wealth and busy lives have led people to eat more meat and less vegetables: their diet is becoming more northern European, with more  convenience foods  and with less of a preventive effect on cardiovascular disease. [96]
