 The  cuisine of  Nauru  is the traditional cuisine of the  island state  on the  Pacific Ocean . 
 Nauru has the  world's highest rate of obesity . [1] 
 
 
 Basic foods [ edit ] 
   Coconut 
 Like its other island neighbors,  Nauruans  consume a large amount of seafood, as well as foods made from coconuts and  pandanus  fruits.  Coconut milk  is also used extensively in Nauru.  Coconut fish  (raw fish, often tuna, served in coconut milk with seasonings) is a traditional dish. 
 The native  Nauruan  names of traditional crops are: [2] [3] 
 
 epo/épo:  Pandanus tectorius 
 ini:  Cocos nucifera 
 Influences [ edit ] 
 Nauruan cuisine is greatly influenced by  Chinese cuisine . The Chinese are the major foreign community of the country, and there are a number of Chinese restaurants on the island, most notably in  Yaren .
 Nauruan cuisine also shows strong Western influence. [4] 
 
 Traditions [ edit ] 
 The majority of Nauruans are Christians, and members of the  Nauru Congregational Church . They often celebrate Christmas with cakes made from banana and coconut.
 Some desserts, such as coconut mousse, are consumed on special occasions.
