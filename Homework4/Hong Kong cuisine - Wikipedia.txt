   A  dim sum  breakfast in Hong Kong 
 Hong Kong cuisine  is mainly influenced by  Cantonese cuisine ,  European cuisines  (especially  British cuisine ) and non-Cantonese Chinese cuisines (especially  Hakka ,  Teochew ,  Hokkien  and  Shanghainese ), as well as  Japanese ,  Korean  and  Southeast Asian  cuisines, due to Hong Kong's past as a  British   colony  and a long history of being an international port of commerce. Complex combinations and international  gourmet  expertise have given Hong Kong the labels of "Gourmet Paradise" and "World's Fair of Food". [1] 
 
 
 Background [ edit ] 
   Tsim Sha Tsui , a major food district in Hong Kong 
 Modern Hong Kong has a predominantly service-based economy, [2]  and restaurant businesses serve as a main economic contributor. With the fourth-densest population per square metre in the world and serving a population of 7 million, [3]  Hong Kong is host to a restaurant industry with intense competition. Due to its small geographical size, Hong Kong contains a high number of restaurants per unit area.
 With Cantonese ethnicity making up 94% of the resident population, [4] [5]   Cantonese cuisine  is naturally served at home. A majority of Chinese in Hong Kong are  Cantonese  in addition to sizable numbers of  Hakka ,  Teochew  and  Shanghainese  peoples, and home dishes are  Cantonese  with occasional mixes of the other three types of cuisines.  Rice  is predominantly the main  staple  for home meals. Home ingredients are picked up from local  grocery stores  and independent produce shops, although  supermarkets  have become progressively more popular.
 Hong Kong homes and kitchens tend to be small due to a high population density, and traditional Chinese cuisine often requires the freshest possible ingredients, so food shopping is undertaken frequently and in smaller quantities than is now usual in the West.  Take-out  and dining out is also very common, since people are often too busy to cook with an average 47-hour work week. [6] 
 
 History [ edit ] 
 19th century: Colonial origins [ edit ] 
 See also:  History of Hong Kong 
 The cuisine of Hong Kong traces its origins to its founding as a  British colonial outpost  in 1841. Soon after the colony was founded, many  Western   merchants  along with Chinese emigrants from nearby  Canton  flocked there to conduct business. Initially, Hong Kong society consisted of  expatriate   upper-class  Westerners,  working-class  Chinese  coolies ,  farmers  and  fishermen , and  middle class  Chinese merchants. The simple  peasant  cuisine was rudimentary compared to the cuisine of 19th century Canton (now commonly known as Guangzhou). [6] 
 As the colony developed, there arose a need for meals to entertain businessmen. Some Chinese restaurants were founded in the late 19th century and early 20th century as branches of renowned restaurants in Canton and offered elaborate meals consisting of traditional Chinese "eight main courses and eight entrees" ( 八大八小 ) types of  banquets  for 2  taels  of silver, at the time equal to a clerk's monthly wage. [7]  Before 1935 when  prostitution  was still legal in Hong Kong, female  escorts  often accompanied diners to restaurant meals, especially those of a business entertainment nature. [ citation needed ]  Until the  Second World War ,  opium  was also offered. For the majority of Chinese who were not part of the merchant class, dining out in restaurants was non-existent and consisted of simple Cantonese country fares. Meat only appeared in festive occasions and celebrations such as birthdays were often done by catering services who prepared the meals at the celebrant's home. The restaurant scene for Europeans in Hong Kong remained separate from Chinese dining. Elaborate Western-style restaurants existed at the likes of  Hongkong Hotel  and subsequently  Gloucester Hotel . [ citation needed ] 
 
 1920s: Cantonese influence [ edit ] 
 Hong Kong's dining lagged behind the then-leader of Chinese cuisine,  Canton , for a long time and many Hong Kong chefs spent their formative years in Canton. Canton was renowned for its food, and there was a traditional saying of " The food is in Canton " ( 食在廣州 ). [8]  Cantonese cuisine in Canton reached its peak during the 1920s and was renowned in the care in preparation even for peasant fares such as  Char siu  or  boat congee .  Dasanyuan  [ zh ]  was renowned for its braised  shark fin  dish that charged 60 silver yuan, equivalent to 6 months' wage for a  working-class  family. [9]  The Guandong cooking style eventually trickled down to the culinary scene in Hong Kong. [10] 
 
 1949: Shanghainese and Western influences [ edit ] 
 The victory of  Chinese Communists  in the  Chinese Civil War  in 1949 created a wave of  refugees  into Hong Kong. A sizeable number of refugees were from non-Cantonese speaking parts of China, including the  Yangtze River Delta , and introduced  Shanghai cuisine  to Hong Kong. On the other hand, most renowned chefs of Canton, now known as  Guangzhou  in pinyin romanisation, settled in Hong Kong to escape from Communist rule in  mainland China . [11] 
 Prostitution and opium had by then long faded from the restaurant scene, and to survive, many restaurants started to tap into profitable new markets by offering  yum cha  and wedding banquets, which coincided with an increasing interest in Western fare by the Chinese in Hong Kong. [6] 
 Egg tarts  and  Hong Kong-style milk tea  soon became part of Hong Kong's food culture. It could be argued that the seeds of Hong Kong society as understood today were not sown until 1949, and the cuisine of Hong Kong has its direct roots in this period. [6] 
 
 1960s–80s:Prosperity [ edit ] 
 By the 1960s, Hong Kong was past the worst of the economic depression, and there was a long and continuous period of relative calm and openness compared to the Communist rule in  Mao Zedong -era China and martial law isolation in Taiwan. The Cantonese cuisine in Hong Kong had by then surpassed that of Guangzhou, which had witnessed a long period of decline after the Communists came to power. The rising prosperity from the mid-1960s had given birth to increasing demand for quality dining. Many of the chefs, who spent their formative years in pre-Communist Guangzhou and Shanghai, started to bring out the best of fine dining specialties from pre-1949 Guangzhou and  Shanghai . Families had largely abandoned catering services and resorted to restaurants for celebratory meals. [12]  Seafood started to become specialised delicacies in the 1960s, followed by  game  in the 1970s.
 This wave of prosperity also propelled Hong Kong Chinese's awareness of foreign food trends, and many were willing to try foreign ingredients such as  asparagus  and  crayfish  from  Australia . Foreign food styles such as  Japanese  and  Southeast Asian cuisine  started to influence local food, and the pace of change accelerated during the late 1970s and early 1980s. This gave birth to nouvelle Cantonese cuisine ( Chinese :  新派粵菜 ;  Cantonese Yale :  Sānpaai Yuhtchoi ) that incorporated foreign dishes such as  sashimi  into Cantonese banquets. [13]  For the first time, many Hong Kong Chinese started to have the economic means to visit many Western restaurants of the domain of mainly wealthy  expatriate  Westerners such as  Gaddi's  of the  Peninsula Hotel . During these years, there was great wealth growth from stock market investments, and one visible manifestation of the resultant  nouveau riche  mentality in 1970s Hong Kong were sayings such as "mixing  shark fin soup  with rice" ( Chinese :  魚翅撈飯 ;  Cantonese Yale :  Yùhchi Lōufaahn ).
 
 1980-90s: links with mainland China and Taiwan [ edit ] 
 China initiated  economic reforms  when  Deng Xiaoping  came to power after  Mao Zedong  died. The opening up of the country gave chefs from Hong Kong chances to reestablish links with chefs from mainland China severed in 1949 and opportunities to gain awareness of various regional Chinese cuisines. Many of these cuisines also contributed to nouvelle Cantonese cuisines in Hong Kong. [14]  The lift of  martial law in Taiwan  in 1987 jump-started Taiwanese links with mainland China and has caused a proliferation of eateries specialising in  Taiwanese cuisine  in Hong Kong as Taiwanese tourists and businessmen used Hong Kong as a midpoint for visits to mainland China. From 1978 until 1997 there was no dispute Hong Kong was the epicenter of Chinese, not only Cantonese, cuisine worldwide, with Chinese restaurants in mainland China and Taiwan, and among overseas Chinese communities, racing to employ chefs trained or worked in Hong Kong and emulating dishes improved upon or invented in Hong Kong. Hong Kong-style Cantonese cuisine ( Cantonese Yale :  Góngsīk Yuhtchoi ) became a coinword for innovative Chinese cuisine during this period. [15]  It was even unofficially rumoured the Chinese government had secretly consulted the head chef for the  Peking Garden Restaurant  [ zh ]  of Hong Kong, part of the  Maxim's restaurant and catering  conglomerate, to teach chefs back at the renowned  Quanjude  restaurant in Beijing how to make good  Peking duck , Quanjude's signature dish, in the early 1980s as the skills to produce the dish were largely lost during the  Cultural Revolution . [ citation needed ] 
 
 Post-1997 [ edit ] 
 After Hong Kong was  returned to China  in 1997, the  Asian financial crisis  and  SARS epidemic  led to a decade-long depression. The boom in Hong Kong culinary scene came to a halt and many restaurants were shuttered, including a number of renowned eateries such as  Sun Tung Lok . It is argued that the catch up in prosperity among populations from coastal regions of China, particularly the nouveau riche (derogatory Chinese:  daai foon  大款) and corrupted officials (derogatory Chinese:  daai ye  大爺), has driven up the demand of many delicacies such as  abalone  and  grouper , and many celebratory dishes have become outrageously expensive that they are beyond the reach of even many upper-middle class Hong Kong families. [ citation needed ]  At the same time, Hong Kong people's tastes have become cosmopolitan when compared with one generation ago. Many are now able to appreciate specific  European  cuisines rather than one generic " Western cuisine ", and appreciation of other Asian cuisines, especially  Japanese cuisine  and  Thai cuisine  has been ever increasing. [ citation needed ]  These have produced a proliferation of many specialist ethnic cuisine restaurants geared towards young middle class couples on one hand, and a consolidation of fine-dining Cantonese restaurants on the other. [ citation needed ] 
 As of the early 21st century Hong Kong, notwithstanding the partial recovery of Hong Kong's economy from the slump in 2003 due to the SARS epidemic, many pundits argue that contemporary Hong Kong's economy is heavily skewed towards  real estate development  and  financial services . This provides prosperity to only a select few minority and an uncertain long-term economic fortune vis-a-vis more diversified mega-rich cities in China such as Shanghai and  Guangzhou , and the territory therefore no longer possesses the economic base to support mass-level super fine-dining that is required to sustain an active dining culture. A common perception of Hong Kong's current culinary culture is one being in decline and resting on past laurels. For example, culinary magazines such as  Eat and Travel Weekly  report fewer fundamentally new dishes being invented in Hong Kong post-2000 than the 1980s heyday, and many restaurants tend to resort to popularise haute dishes invented in the 1980s. [ citation needed ]  Modern Hong Kong's labour market has also disrupted the traditional ways of grooming Chinese chefs, which henceforth been trained in a very long and drawn one-to-one practical apprenticeships. Very few chefs are willing to sacrifice their time and effort to produce traditional cooking that discourages cutting corners, and emphasises techniques over ingredients' net economic worth. [16]  On the other hand, a minority of optimistic pundits argue Hong Kong may well develop a foodie culture similar to other developed economies and preserve the best of traditional cooking.
 Historically, Hong Kong's food source came from a combination of mini stores instead of supermarkets. Some of the stores included:  rice dealers  ( Chinese :  米舖 ;  Cantonese Yale :  Máihpou ), serving as mini rice storage warehouses;  wine shops  ( Chinese :  辦館 ;  Cantonese Yale :  Baahn gún ), which offered beverages;  convenient stores  ( Chinese :  士多 ;  Cantonese Yale :  Sidō , Cantonese rendering of "store"), which were single convenient stores, most notable for serving fresh baked bread. The main component was  wet markets  ( Chinese :  街市 ;  Cantonese Yale :  Gāaisíh ) – one of the first market gatherings in Hong Kong was  Central Market  that began in the 1840s.
 The idea of a single facility or supermarket that provided all food ingredients did not take place until the early  1970s  when  Wellcome , a local grocery chain, changed its format into a supermarket. Air-conditioned supermarkets did not become standardised until the 1980s. The early 21st century Western environmentalism- or  sustainability -inspired food trends, such as  natural food ,  organic food ,  non-genetically modified food ,  local food , and  farmer's markets , have been ignored by a majority of Hong Kong's populations. The Western  farmer's market  share some similarities with the traditional Chinese  wet markets , however support of wet markets is largely based on traditional Chinese cultural preference rather than sustainability, and wet markets contain many features that are condemned by modern Western environmentalists on the grounds of "animal cruelty" (live animals sold for food) and "high food miles" (fruits and seafood from another continent).

 Eating habits [ edit ] 
   People enjoying a meal 
 Most restaurant serving sizes are considerably small by international standards, especially in comparison to most Western nations like the  United States  and  Canada . The  main course  is usually accompanied by a generous portion of carbohydrates such as rice or  mein  (noodles). People generally eat 5 times a day. [1] 
 
 Ingredients [ edit ] 
 Similar to Cantonese cuisine elsewhere, Hong Kong's cooking uses a wide variety of ingredients and the common ones include:

 Hawker [ edit ] 
   Hawker selling roasted  chestnuts 
 Main article:  Hawkers in Hong Kong 
 These are basically streetside food stalls, operated by usually one or two people pushing a cart. The carts are usually very mobile, allowing the business freedom to sell snacks in whichever area is most populated at a particular point in time. While they have been popular in the 1970s and 1980s, tight health regulations and other forms of  lease  versus  licensed  hawker restrictions have put a burden on this mobile food culture. [17]  The term  Jau Gwei  became associated with the hawkers trying to avoid restrictions.
 Includes: 
 
 Fish ball 
 Put chai ko  (Port cake or 砵仔糕) 
 Egg waffle 
 Roasted chestnuts 
 Cantonese cuisine [ edit ] 
   Dim Sum 
 Main articles:  Cantonese cuisine  and  Dim Sum 
 As the most predominant cultural group in Hong Kong, Cantonese food forms the backbone of homecooking and dine-out scenes. Many early celebrated Cantonese restaurants, including  Tai San Yuan ,  Luk Yu Tea House , were originally Hong Kong branches of the famed Guangzhou-based restaurants, and most chefs in Hong Kong until the 1970s had spent their formative years working in the restaurant industry in  Guangzhou . [18]  Most of the celebrated dishes in Hong Kong were introduced into the territory through Guangzhou, often refined with awareness of international tastes. Cantonese food prices perhaps cover the widest range, from the  small businesses   lou mei  to the most expensive  abalone  delicacies, which involve abalone.
 One well developed dish in Cantonese cuisine is  dim sum . Waiters cart around stacks of steamer baskets or small plates of food for customers to choose. Dim sum includes dishes based on meat, seafood, vegetables, as well as desserts and fruit. The term  yum cha  (literally "drink tea") is synonymous with eating dim sum for Hong Kong people. It is customary for families to eat dim sum on weekends. Most foods are steamed, traditionally.
 Includes: 
 
 Cart noodle 
 Siu mei 
 Cha siu baau 
 Shaomai 
 Ha gau 
 Steamed meatball 
 Lo mai gai 
 Fun guo 
 Tofu skin roll 
 Spring roll 
 Rice noodle roll 
 Crispy fried chicken 
 Seafood birdsnest 
 Pork knuckles and ginger stew 
 Hot pot [ edit ] 
   Hot Pot 
 Main article:  Hot pot 
 This hot pot cuisine, known as  daa bin lou  ( Chinese :  打邊爐 ;  Jyutping :  daa 2  bin 1  lou 4 ;  pinyin :  dǎbiānlú ) in  Cantonese , is unique in the sense that everyone is a  chef . A boiling pot of water (soup-based, and customers can choose their preferred soup taste), is placed in the center of the table, and essentially everyone boils their own ingredients in that pot. This is highly popular and is usually accompanied with a bottle of cold beer or soda. This style is common during frigid winter times, since people are essentially huddled around a fire. This format is also considered entertaining.
 Includes: 
 
 Beef, pork,  chicken 
 Crab,  prawns , and  clams 
 Chinese cabbage , carrots and lettuce 
 Fish balls  and  beef balls 
 Tofu 
 Hong Kong-style drinks [ edit ] 
 Non-alcoholic beverages  are particularly associated with  Cha chaan teng , a unique kind of restaurants in Hong Kong. Since drink recipes are not franchise based, most drinks can vary depending on the restaurant.  Rock sugar  and  syrup  are commonly used to add sweetness.
 Some beverages that originated in  the tea culture  of Taiwan, such as  bubble tea  and  honey green tea , had been brought to Hong Kong and become part of Hong Kong's beverage culture.
 Includes: 
 
 Hong Kong-style milk tea 
 Red bean ice 
 Soy milk 
 Sugarcane juice 
 Lemon tea 
 Chinese tea [ edit ] 
   Chinese Tea 
 Main article:  Hong Kong tea culture 
 A large wide variety of tea leaves and combinations are used for Chinese tea. In the 1950s and 1960s, citizens would go to tea houses accompanied by their pet birds locked in a bird cage. [ clarification needed ]   Noon tea  was an essential break in the middle of the day. Tea nowadays goes along with any meal.
 Includes: 
 
 Chrysanthemum tea 
 Bolay 
 24 flavors 
 Western styles [ edit ] 
   Hong Kong-style French toast 
 Hong Kong-style Western cuisine [ edit ] 
 Dishes derived from cuisines of the Western world, but not classified into a particular country, belong in this category. Outside Hong Kong, it is termed  Hong Kong-style Western cuisine  or  Canto-Western cuisine . Small restaurants that offer Sai Chaan (西餐) are usually  cha chaan teng  (茶餐廳) at the popular end or "Sai Chaan Restaurants" (西餐廳) at the more upscale range. Restaurants that have come to expect tourists will likely offer both east and west menus. Most dishes are localised with Chinese tastes [19]  and contain Chinese and specifically Cantonese influences, such as  steak  marinated in  soy sauce , served in a soy sauce dominated  gravy , and with  fried rice  as on the side, or pasta. [20] 
 Includes: 
 
 Egg tart [21] 
 Macaroni  in broth with  fried egg  and  sausage  / thinly-sliced  ham 
 Fried chicken wings, sometimes served with French fries and salad 
 Swiss sauce chicken wings 
 Instant noodles  with sausages, fried eggs or thinly-sliced ham 
 French toast , called "Western Toast" (西多士 sai do si, shortened from 法蘭西多士 fat laan sai do si, transliteration of French toast) in Chinese 
 Baked pork chop rice, baked with fried pork chop and fried rice, usually served with tomato sauce and cheese [22] 
 Hong Kong Style  Borscht  Soup (cooked with tomatoes, but usually with no  beetroot  or  sour cream ) 
 Hong Kong style milk tea , a beverage made of Ceylon tea, black tea, and milk. [23] 
 Lemon tea (black tea with slices of fresh lemon), served hot or cold, usually with syrup.
