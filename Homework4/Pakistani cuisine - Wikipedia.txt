   Located on the bank of the  Arabian Sea  in  Karachi ,  Port Grand  is one of the largest food streets of  Asia . [1] 
   Food street located on  Stadium  Road,  Sargodha 
 Pakistani cuisine  ( Urdu :  پاکستانی پکوان ,  romanized :  pākistānī pakwān ) can be characterized by a blend of various regional cooking traditions from  South Asia ,  Central  and  Western Asia , as well as elements from its  Mughal  legacy. [2] [3]  The country's various cuisines are derived from its  ethnic  and  cultural  diversity.
 Pakistani cuisine is based on  Halal  principles, which forbids pork and alcohol consumption in accordance with  Sharia , the religious laws of  Islam .
 International cuisine and  fast food  are popular in major cities such as  Islamabad  and  Karachi ; blending local and foreign recipes ( fusion food ), such as  Pakistani Chinese cuisine , is also common in large urban centres. As a result of lifestyle changes, ingredients such as  masala  (mixed and ready-to-use spices) and  ghee  (clarified butter) are becoming increasingly popular.
 
 
 Historical influences [ edit ] 
 Main article:  History of Pakistani cuisine 
 Pakistan 's national cuisine directly inherits both  Indo-Aryan  and  Iranic  culture, coupled with  Muslim  culinary traditions. Evidence of controlled preparatory cuisine in the region can be traced back to as early as the  Bronze Age  with the  Indus Valley Civilization . Around 3000 BCE,  sesame ,  eggplant , and  humped cattle  were  domesticated  in the Indus Valley, [4]  and spices like  turmeric ,  cardamom ,  black pepper  and  mustard  were harvested in the region concurrently. [5]  For at least a thousand years,  wheat  and  rice  formed the basic foodstuff in the Indus Valley. [6] 
 The arrival of  Islam  in  South Asia  through trade and intermittent  conquests  influenced the local cuisine of the region to a great degree; due to its Muslim-majority population, Pakistan's cuisine sees a strict observance of  Islamic dietary laws . Most prominently,  forbiddance  on the consumption of  pork  and  alcohol  by Islamic regulation has shifted the focus of Pakistani cuisine to other types of meat, such as  beef ,  lamb ,  chicken , and  fish , alongside a variety of  fruits ,  vegetables , and  dairy .

 Meal structure [ edit ] 
   A  Punjabi / Sindhi -style wooden woven plate for  chapati  (flat bread) 
 Pakistanis generally eat three meals a day, which are breakfast, lunch, and dinner. During the evening, many families have tea, which goes along with baked/fried snacks from a local bakery (or prepared at home). During the Islamic holy month of  Ramadan , the eating patterns change to  suhur , pronounced “Sehar” in Pakistan, and  iftar . It is considered proper to eat only with the right hand as per Islamic tradition (also a tradition in many other Asian cultures). Many Pakistani families, particularly when guests are too many to fit at a table, eat sitting at a cloth known as  Dastarkhān , which is spread out on the floor. In Pakistan, many street eateries serve food on a  takht , in a style similar to what is seen in  Afghanistan . A takht is a raised platform, where people eat their food sitting cross-legged, after taking tith sauce with a piece of baked bread ( naan ) or rice.
 
 Breakfast [ edit ] 
   Having  Nihari  and  Halwa Puri  in breakfast is popular among people living in  Lahore . 
 A typical Pakistani breakfast, locally called  nāshtā  ( ناشتہ ), consists of  eggs  (boiled/scrambled/fried/omelette), a slice of loaf bread or  roti ,  parathas ,  sheermal  with  tea  or  lassi ,  kulcha  with  chole ,  qeema  (minced meat), fresh seasonal fruits ( mangoes ,  apples ,  melons ,  bananas , etc.),  milk ,  honey ,  butter ,  jam ,  shami kebab  or  nuts . Sometimes breakfast includes baked goods like  bakarkhani  and  rusks . During holidays and weekends,  halwa poori  and  chickpeas  are sometimes eaten. In  Punjab ,  sarson ka saag  (mustard leaves) and  maakai ki roti  (cornbread) is a local favourite. Punjabi people also enjoy khatchauri, a savory pastry filled with cheese. Pakistan is not unlike many other Asian nations, in the sense that meat dishes are eaten as breakfast, especially on holidays. A traditional Sunday breakfast might be  Siri-Payay  (the head and feet of lamb or cow) or  Nihari  ( نہاری ) (a dish which is cooked overnight to get the meat extremely tender. The name "Nihari" comes from the Arabic word "Nahar", meaning "Day" or "Day break".) Many people used to eat "Bong" (Shank curry) in their Sunday brunch.
 
 Lunch [ edit ] 
 A typical Pakistani lunch consists of meat curry or  shorba  (depending on the region) along with a carbohydrate such as  rice  or  roti .  Daal  chawal is among the most commonly served dishes at lunch. Breads such as  roti  or  naan  are usually served for dinner, but have become more common during the day; rice may be served for dinner as well. Popular lunch dishes may include  aloo gosht  (meat and potato stew) or a vegetable and mutton salan (stew). Chicken dishes like chicken karahi are also popular. Alternatively, roadside food stalls often sell just  lentils  and tandoori rotis, or masala stews with  chapatis . People who live near the main rivers also eat fish for lunch, which is sometimes cooked in the tandoori style.
 
 Dinner [ edit ]

These are served with a bread such as  roti  or  naan  or rice,  along with yogurt, pickle and salad. The dinner may sometimes be followed by fresh fruit, or on festive occasions, traditional desserts like  kheer ,  gulab jamun , shahi tukray, gajraila,  qulfi  or  ras malai .

Assorted fresh fruit or sometimes desserts are consumed at the end of a meal. [ citation needed ]   Meat  plays a much more dominant role in Pakistani food, compared to other  South Asian cuisines . According to a 2003 report, an average Pakistani consumed three times more meat than an average Indian. [10]  Of all the meats, the most popular are  goat ,  lamb and mutton ,  beef  and  chicken , which are particularly sought after as the meats of choice for kebab dishes or the classic beef shank dish  nihari .  Seafood  is generally not consumed in large amounts, though it is [11]  very popular in the coastal areas of  Sindh  and the  Makran  coast of  Balochistan  and was a dominant element of the cuisine of the former  East Pakistan  (now  Bangladesh ).
 Dishes, with or without meat, combined with local vegetables, such as  bitter gourd ,  cauliflower ,  eggplant ,  okra ,  cabbage ,  potatoes ,  rutabaga ,  saag , and  chili peppers  are most common and cooked for everyday consumption. A typical example is  aloo gosht  (literally "potatoes and meat"), a homestyle recipe consisting of a spiced meat and potato stew, and is ubiquitously prepared in many households.  Korma  is a classic dish of Mughlai origin made of either chicken or mutton, typically eaten with naan or other bread, and is very popular in Pakistan.

While  lentils  (called  daal ) and  chickpeas  (called channa/chanay ki daal) are popular ingredients in homestyle cooking, they are traditionally considered to be inexpensive food sources.

 Varieties of bread [ edit ] 
   Chapati (bread) with a piece of chicken meat 
   Peshwari naans freshly made in the tandoor (open oven) Main article:  List of Pakistani breads 
 Pakistanis eat breads made of wheat flour as a  staple part  of their daily diet. Pakistan has a wide variety of breads, often prepared in a traditional clay oven called a  tandoor . The tandoori style of cooking is common throughout rural and urban Pakistan, and also has strong roots in neighboring India, Iran and Afghanistan. Some of these are:
 
 Chapati  - Most common bread made in urban homes, where a tandoor is not available. Chapatis are cooked over a flat or slightly convex dark colored pan known as 'tava'. Chapatis are made of  whole-wheat flour  and are thin and unleavened.  Tortillas  are probably the most common analogous to chapatis, though chapatis are slightly thick. A variant, known as 'romali roti' (lit. Handkerchief bread), is very thin and very large in size. 
 Kandahari Naan - Long, salty naan originating in Western Pakistan and commonly eaten with Peshawari Karahi or  Chapli Kebab . 
 Kulcha  - This is a type of naan usually eaten with chickpeas and potatoes and mostly popular in urban centers of  Punjab . 
 Naan  - In  Urdu , the national language of  Pakistan , the word  Naan  means bread. Unlike chapatis, naans are slightly thicker, typically leavened with  yeast  and mainly made with white  flour . Some varieties like Roghani and Peshwari naan may also be sprinkled with  sesame seeds . Naans are seldom, if ever, made at home since they require tandoor based cooking and require prep work. Numerous varieties of plain, as well as stuffed naans are available throughout  Pakistan  and each region or city can have their own specialty. Naan is a versatile bread and is eaten with almost anything. For instance, 'saada naan' or 'plain naan', is often served with  Siri-Payay  (cow's head and trotters) or  Nihari  (slow cooked beef stew) for breakfast in many parts of the country. 
 Paratha  - A flat, layered bread made with  ghee  or cooking oil and generally cooked on a 'tava'. However, a 'tandoor' based version is also common in rural areas. Parathas are very similar to pastry dough. Parathas most likely originated in the  Punjab , where a heavy breakfast of parathas with freshly churned butter and buttermilk was commonly consumed by the farmers to prepare themselves for the hard day of work ahead. However, parathas are now a common breakfast element across the country. Along with the plain layered version, many stuffed versions, such as 'Aloo ka Paratha' (Potato stuffed paratha), 'Mooli ka Paratha' (Radish stuffed paratha), and 'Qeemah ka Paratha' (Ground meat stuffed paratha) are popular. 
 Puri  - This is a breakfast bread made of white flour and fried. Typically eaten with sweet semolina  halwa  or gravy (made out of  chickpeas  and  potatoes ). Puri is a fairly urban concept in Pakistan and puris are not part of rural cuisine anywhere in  Pakistan . However, Halwa Puri has now become a favored weekend or holiday breakfast in urban Pakistan, where it is sometimes sold in shift carts or in specialty breakfast shops. 
 Roghani Naan (lit. Buttered Naan) - It is a preferred variety of Naan sprinkled with white sesame seeds and cooked with a small amount of oil. 
 Roti  - This bread is extremely popular all over Pakistan. Tandoori rotis are baked in a clay oven, known as a  tandoor , and are consumed with just about anything. In rural  Pakistan , many houses have their own tandoors, while the ones without it use a communal one. In urban  Pakistan , bread shops or "nanbai"/"tandoor" shops are fairly common and supply fresh, tandoor baked breads to household customers. 
 Sheermal  – Saffron-flavored traditional flatbread. It is a festive bread prepared with  milk  ('sheer') and  butter  with added candied fruits. Sheermal is often a vital part of food served in marriages, along with  taftan . It is often sweetened. 
 Taftan  - This is a leavened flour bread with saffron and a small amount of cardamom powder baked in a tandoor. The taftan made in Pakistan is slightly sweeter and richer than the one made in neighboring Iran.

 Besides tea, there are other drinks that may be included as part of the Pakistani cuisine. All of them are non-alcoholic as the consumption of alcohol is prohibited by Islam. During the 20th century, beverages such as  coffee  and  soft drinks  have also become popular in Pakistan. It is very common to have soft drinks nowadays with Pakistani meals.

 In addition to the traditional food, fast food is also very famous across the country. [12]  In big cities, there is a presence of outlets of many International Fast Food Restaurants that includes  KFC ,  McDonald's ,  Pizza Hut ,  Subway ,  Domino's ,  Burger King ,  Hardee's ,  Papa John's Pizza ,  Dunkin' Donuts ,  Baskin-Robbins  and  Taco Bell  etc. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] 
 Occasionally, many people in  Pakistan  have dinner outside at a restaurant with foreign-influenced food, such as Western, Arab and Chinese dishes. Many westernized, Chinese restaurants and fast food outlets are dotted in all urban parts of Pakistan. The Punjab and Sindh provinces, where the majority of urban chains of many American, European and British restaurants have opened in many metropolitan cities, such as  Karachi ,  Lahore ,  Faisalabad ,  Islamabad-Rawalpindi ,  Gujranwala ,  Peshawar ,  Multan ,  Hyderabad ,  Quetta ,  Sargodha ,  Bahawalpur ,  Sialkot ,  Sukkur ,  Larkana  and many others. Marketing and advertisements have made these a haven for social and modern spots for all Pakistanis to try out.
 Outside Pakistan, Pakistani cuisine is prevalent in countries, where there are large Pakistani communities present.
 Pakistani food makes use of fresh hand-pounded  masalas .  Ghee  is used, but the main component of the meal or a dish is  meat  ( beef ,  lamb ,  chicken ,  goat , or  fish ), and  vegetables  are sparingly used. Surprisingly, Pakistani food also makes extensive use of  olive oil . Sparingly used vegetables does not mean there is no  vegetarian food  on the menu. Since the cuisine is very similar to  Punjabi-style of cooking ,  tikka , simmered  dals , tawa sabzi, and  chaat  feature here. [22]
