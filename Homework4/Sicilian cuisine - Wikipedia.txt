 Sicilian cuisine  is the style of cooking on the island of  Sicily . It shows traces of all cultures that have existed on the island of Sicily over the last two millennia. [2]  Although its cuisine has much in common with  Italian cuisine , Sicilian food also has  Greek ,  Spanish ,  French  and  Arab  influences. [3] 
 The Sicilian cook  Mithaecus , born during 5th century BC, is credited with having brought knowledge of Sicilian gastronomy to  Greece : [4]  his cookbook was the first in Greek, therefore he was the earliest cookbook author in any language whose name is known.
 
 
 History [ edit ] 
 Much of the island was initially  settled by Greek colonists ,  who left a preference for  fish ,  wheat ,  olives ,  grapes ,  broad beans ,  chickpeas ,  lentils ,  almonds ,  pistachios ,   and fresh vegetables.
 Arab  influences on Sicilian cuisine trace to the  Arab domination of Sicily  in the 10th and early 11th centuries, [5]  and include the use of  sugar ,  citrus ,  rice ,  raisins ,  pine nuts  and spices such as  saffron ,  nutmeg , and  cinnamon .  Norman  influences are also found, such as in the fondness for  meat  dishes. [6]  The  Jewish  community, who lived in the island, also left their mark on the Sicilian cuisine, they were responsible for introducing garlic fried in olive oil into the sauce. [7]  Later, the  Spanish  introduced  numerous items from the New World , including  cocoa ,  maize ,  peppers ,  zucchini ,  potatoes , and  tomatoes , along with other  produce . [5]  Much of the island's cuisine encourages the use of fresh vegetables such as  eggplant ,  artichoke , and tomatoes, and fish such as  tuna ,  sea bream ,  sea bass ,  cuttlefish , and  swordfish . In  Trapani  in the extreme western corner of the island,  North African  influences are clear in the use of  couscous .
 
 Dishes [ edit ]

 Starters [ edit ] 
 The starters (called  antipasti ) are an important aspect of Sicilian cuisine. Common Sicilian starters include  caponata  and  gatò di patate  (a kind of potato and cheese pie).
 
 Soups [ edit ] 
 Maccu  is a Sicilian  soup  and foodstuff prepared with  fava beans  as a primary ingredient. [8]  It is a  peasant food [9]  and  staple   that dates back to  ancient history . [8]   Maccu di San Giuseppe  ( English :  maccu  of St. Joseph) is a traditional Sicilian dish that consists of various ingredients and  maccu . [10]  The dish may be prepared on  Saint Joseph's Day  in Sicily, to clear out pantries and allow room for the spring's new crops of vegetables. [10] 
 
 Pasta [ edit ] 
 Sicily is the oldest Italian and Western location on record where  pasta  worked into long and thin form was part of the local cuisine. This dates back to around the 12th century, as attested by the  Tabula Rogeriana  of  Muhammad al-Idrisi , reporting some traditions about the  Sicilian kingdom . [11] 
 Spaghetti ai ricci di mare  ( spaghetti  prepared with  sea urchin ),  pasta   con le sarde  (with  sardines ) and  pasta alla Norma  (a specialty that originated in  Catania ) are the most popular pasta dishes that are typically Sicilian.  Cannelloni  is another common dish. Another popular dish in eastern Sicily is pasta with  capuliato .
 
 Main dish [ edit ] 
 After the pasta, the typical Sicilian menu includes a second or main dish ( secondi ) based on meat or fish. Main dishes based on seafood are  couscous   al pesce  and  pesce spada alla ghiotta  ( swordfish ).
 
 Desserts and sweets [ edit ] 
 See also:  List of Italian desserts  and  List of Italian dishes § Desserts and pastry 
 Sweets are another specialty. Examples include:  frutta martorana ,  Pignolata   of Messina ,  buccellato ,  cannoli ,  granita ,  cassata   siciliana  and the  Crocetta   of Caltanissetta , a sweet that disappeared and was rediscovered in 2014. [12] 
 Candy in Sicily was heavily influenced by the Arab candymakers in the 9th century, and Sicilian candy has preserved more of that influence than almost any other place in Europe. [13]   Marzipan  fruits may have been invented at the  Convent of Eloise at Martorana  in the 14th century. In the 17th and 18th centuries, many Sicilian monasteries produced candies and pastries, some with sexual or fertility themes. The only surviving convent to follow this tradition is the Monastery of the  Virgins of Palermo , which makes breast-shaped cakes in honor of Saint  Agatha of Sicily . [13] 
 
   Cassate  are popular and traditional Sicilian  desserts . 
 Traditional sugar statues, called  pupa di cena , are still made, although now featuring modern celebrities or culture figures. [13] 
 
   An almond  granita  with brioche 
 Granita  is particularly famous and well known. It is a semi-frozen dessert of sugar, water, and flavourings originally from the island, and is commonly associated with  Messina  or  Catania , even though there is no evident proof that it hails from any particular Sicilian city. Related to  sorbet  and  Italian ice , in most of Sicily it has a coarser, more crystalline texture. Food writer  Jeffrey Steingarten  says that "the desired texture seems to vary from city to city" on the island; on the west coast and in  Palermo , it is at its chunkiest, and in the east it is nearly as smooth as  sorbet . [14]  This is largely the result of different freezing techniques: the smoother types are produced in a  gelato machine , while the coarser varieties are frozen with only occasional agitation, then scraped or shaved to produce separated crystals.
 
 Fruits [ edit ] 
   Tarocco  blood oranges 
 Citrus fruits  are a popular ingredient in Sicilian cuisine. Many were first introduced by the  Arabs  from the 9th to 11th centuries, but some, such as the Washington navel from  Brazil , have been brought to the island more recently. Examples of citrus fruits found in Sicily are : [15] 
 
 Biondo comune  - the "common blonde" orange 
 Ovale  - ripens between April and May, with a compact flesh 
 Sanguigno comune  - common blood orange harvested between January and April 
 Washington navel - introduced from  Brazil  during the 1940s-1950s, grown chiefly near  Ribera  and  Sciacca  and harvested from November to January 
 Sanguinella  - bitter orange of the  blood orange  variety, found in Paternò Santa Maria di Licodia,  Palagonia ,  Scordia  and  Francofonte  during January until April 
 Tarocco  - high quality blood orange found in  Catania ,  Siracusa  and Francofonte from November to January 
 Tarocco dal muso  - bell shaped orange found in Francofonte 
 Valencia  - similar to the Ovale and used often in  confectionery  items 
 Moro  - crimson colored flesh found in  Lentini , Scordia, and Francofonte from mid-January until the end of April 
 Comune  - common variety of the  mandarin orange 
 Mandarino tardivo di Ciaculli   [  it ]  - a second variety of the mandarin orange found in Sicily 
 Femminello ,  Siracusa lemon  - the lemon that makes up 80% of Sicily's lemon crop, found in Catania,  Syracuse ,  Messina  and Palermo 
 Monachello  - "little monk" lemon harvested from October from March and able to withstand drought better that the  Femminello 
 Verdello  - a lime that grows particularly well and is harvested from May to September 
 Wines and drinks [ edit ] 
   Limoncello  is a popular and strong lemon liqueur. 
 The drink most often served with the main meal in Sicily is  wine . The soil and climate in Sicily are ideal for  growing grapes , mainly due to  Mount Etna , and a wine-making tradition on the island has existed since the Greeks first set up colonies on the island. Today, all Sicilian provinces produce wine and Sicilian wine produced by modern methods has established itself on the European wine market.
 Sicilian  red wines  have an alcoholic content of 12.5 to 13.5% and are usually drunk in the evening with roast or grilled meat. Well-known red wines include the  Cerasuolo di Vittoria  and the  Nero d'Avola , mainly those produced around  Noto  (Siracusa). The dry and  white wines  and  rosés  usually have an alcoholic content from 11.5 to 12.5% and are mainly consumed with fish, poultry and pasta dishes. Sicily is also known for producing  dessert wines , such as  Marsala  and the  Malvasia delle Lipari .
 Other common Sicilian alcoholic drinks include  limoncello , a lemon liqueur, and  Amaro Siciliano , a herbal drink, which is often consumed after meals as a  digestive .
 
 Street food [ edit ] 
   Arancini  from  Ragusa, Sicily . Arancini are fried or (less often) baked rice balls usually filled with  ragù  (meat sauce),  tomato sauce ,  mozzarella  or  peas , and then coated in bread crumbs. 
 Sicilians eat large quantities of street food, including the renowned  arancini  (a form of  deep-fried  rice  croquettes ). Popular street foods include,  pani ca meusa  and  pane e  panelle  in the  Palermo  region,  cartocciate  [  it ]  and  cipolline  in the  Catania  region, and Focaccia messinese   [  it ]  and  Pidone   [  it ]   messinese  (or  Pitone  or  Pidune , in dialect) [16]   in the  Messina  region.
