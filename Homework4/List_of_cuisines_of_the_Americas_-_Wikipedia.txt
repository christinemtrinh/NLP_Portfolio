 This is a list of cuisines of the Americas.  A cuisine is a characteristic style of cooking practices and traditions,[1] often associated with a specific culture.  The cuisines found across North and South America are based on the cuisines of the countries from which the immigrant peoples came, primarily Europe. However, traditional European cuisine has been adapted with the addition of local ingredients, and many techniques have been added to the tradition as well.

 The dishes made in the previously British and French Islands and territories in the Caribbean are much more diverse than the islands colonized by Spanish due to a history of changing colonial administration or ownership (between British, French, Dutch and Spanish), and the migration of diverse groups brought to work on plantations including Indians from Indian, Chinese and Portuguese (Madeira and Azores).
 There is even much diversity within each previous colonial groupings. While both Trinidad and Jamaica were both British colonies and share similar cooking styles, the scope of dishes in Trinidad are different and more diverse due to a very different population make up. 
The similarities in the larger region lie mostly in the fruits and vegetables consumed and the ingredients used in cooking, with the use of root vegetables, plantains, beans, and rice, fish and seafood being a common denominator. In the post independence and post colonial era, and with globalization in the 1990s cultural and food similarities between the previous British, still French and Dutch Island and territories were magnified.
