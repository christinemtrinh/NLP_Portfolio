 Traditional Kazakh cuisine  is the traditional food of the Kazakh people. It is focused on  mutton  and  horse meat , as well as various  milk products . For hundreds of years,  Kazakhs  were herders who raised fat-tailed sheep, Bactrian camels, and horses, relying on these animals for transportation, clothing, and food. [1]  The cooking techniques and major ingredients have been strongly influenced by the nation's  nomadic  way of life. For example, most cooking techniques are aimed at long-term  preservation of food . There is a large practice of salting and drying meat so that it will last, and there is a preference for  sour milk , as it is easier to save in a nomadic lifestyle. [2] 
 Meat  in various forms has always been the primary ingredient of Kazakh cuisine, and traditional Kazakh cooking is based on boiling. Horse and mutton are the most popular forms of meat and are most often served in large uncut pieces which have been boiled. Kazakhs cared especially for horses which they intended to slaughter—keeping them separate from other animals and feeding them so much that they often became so fat they had difficulty moving. [3]

 Meat dishes [ edit ] 
 The majority of Kazakh cuisine is  tört tülik mal  ( төрт түлiк мал ) – four kinds of cattle (i.e. four kinds of meat): horses, camels, cows, and sheep.  Horse  and  camel  meat are the two main types of festive meats, with horse being the main and camel being not as common for festivities (as camels in Kazakhstan are not as common as horses).  Sheep  and  cow  meat are more common meats and are eaten more in everyday life.
 Etqamyr  ( ет ) or  besbarmaq  ( бесбармақ ), a dish consisting of boiled horse or  mutton  meat is the most popular Kazakh dish. It is also called "five fingers" because of the way it is eaten. The chunks of boiled meat are cut and served by the host in order of the guests’ importance.  Besbarmaq  is usually eaten with a boiled  pasta  sheet, and a meat broth called  sorpa  ( сорпа ), and is traditionally served in Kazakh bowls called  kese  ( кесе ).  Quwyrdaq  ( қуырдақ ) is another  Kazakh's national dish.  
 Other popular meat dishes are  qazy  ( қазы ), which is a horse meat sausage that only the wealthy could afford, [4]   shuzhyq  ( шұжық ) (horse meat sausages),  Quwyrdaq , a dish made from roasted horse,  sheep , or  cow   offal , with the heart, liver, kidneys, and other organs, diced and served with  onions  and  peppers , [1]  and various horse delicacies, such as  zhal  ( жал ) (smoked  lard  from horse's neck) and  zhaya  ( жая ) (salted and smoked meat from horse's hip and hind leg). [5] 
 Another popular dish is  palaw  ( палау ), which is made from meat fried with  carrots , onions or  garlic , then cooked with  rice . [ clarification needed ] , also known as crackler, is melted fat in a large bowl with  sugar , eaten by dipping it with bread and is often served with  tea .  Qiymay  ( қимай ) is a  sausage  made during fall and winter slaughtering and is made by stuffing intestines with pieces of  ground meat , fat, blood, garlic,  salt , and  black pepper .  Zhawbüyrek  ( жаубүйрек ), also known as  käwap  ( кәуап ), is popular among hunters and travelers and is a dish in which small pieces of meat are roasted over a fire.  Ülpershek  ( үлпершек ) is a dish made from the heart, aorta, and fat of a horse, prepared in a  kettle , and is often shared between sisters-in-law as a sign of unity. 
 Qazy  ( қазы ) is a sausage eaten in the spring when a cow has a new calf; it is a giant sausage sometimes served with  rice  or  qurt .  Miypalaw  ( мипалау ) is a dish made from sheep's brain, made by putting the brain in a wooden bowl, adding marrow, pieces of meat, salted fat in broth, and garlic, and this dish is then often served to honored guests.  Aqshelek  ( ақшелек ) is a large  camel  bone distributed to children after slaughtering and cooking meat from a camel.
 Qiymay  is another kind of sausage eaten later in the year after it has aged—if smoked it will last a long time, something important in Kazakh cooking.  Zhal  is the layer of fat under a horse's mane and is served only to special and honored guests, as it is such a rare commodity.  Zhaya  is the rump of a horse, probably served boiled.  Aq Sorpa  ( ақ сорпа ) is a white broth made in the fall, and is a special meal for rich men.  Quyryq-bawyr  ( құйрық-бауыр ) is a meal which used to be served to kinsmen at wedding parties. It is made from boiled meat, sliced thinly, then  sour milk  and salted broth are added. [4] 
 Sür et  ( сүр ет ) is salted horsemeat that smoked over  elm ,  juniper  or  meadowsweet . [6] 
 
 Milk dishes 
 Traditional milk products include  süt  ( сүт ), which is boiled  milk .  Qaymaq  ( қаймақ ) is  sour cream  made from boiled milk, and is sometimes served with tea.  Sary may  ( сары май ) is  butter  made from old milk, often in a leather bag.  Qurt  is prepared by pressing thick sour cream, and is dried until white and salty.  Irimshik  ( ірімшік ) is a  cottage cheese  processed in the spring, made from boiled, unskimmed milk and added sour cream. 
 Süzbe  ( сүзбе ) and  Qatyq  ( қатық ) are strained and thickened sour milk.  Qoryqtyq  ( қорықтық ) is a herdsman's food, which is thickened milk made out on the steppe.  Tosap  ( тосап ) is made from the scum on the sides of a metal pot and is used as medicine.  Ayran  ( айран ) is sour milk used in winter and summer.  Shalğam  ( шалғам ), which is radish salad, and finally,  shubat  ( шұбат ) and  qymyz  ( қымыз ) (fermented  camel ’s milk and fermented  mare ’s milk) are seen as good for one’s health and are imbibed often. [4] 
 
 Breads 
 The introduction of  flour  to Kazakh cuisine brought about dishes such as  bawyrsaq  ( бауырсақ ),  shelpek  ( шелпек ),  mänti  ( мәнті ), and  nan  ( нан ).  Bawyrsaq  is made by frying dough balls, and  shelpek  is a flat cake made in a similar fashion. [7]   Mänti , a very popular Kazakh dish, is a spiced mixture of ground  lamb  (or  beef ) spiced with black pepper, enclosed in a dough wrapper.  Mänti  are cooked in a multi-level steamer and served topped with butter, sour cream, or onion sauce.  Nan  is a type of traditional bread made in the  tandyr  oven, popular in cities along the Silk Way.  Quymaq  ( құймақ ),  qattama  ( қаттама ), and  oyma  ( ойма ) are flat puff  cakes  fried in oil then covered in  cream . Another sweet is  shek-shek  ( шек-шек ).

 Beverages [ edit ]

 The traditional drinks are fermented  mare 's milk ( qymyz ), [8]  camel's milk ( shubat ), [9]  cow's milk ( Ayran ), and  sheep's milk , as well as their products  qaymaq  ( sour cream ),  qatyq  or  ayran  ( buttermilk ),  qurt  (which is made from dried  cheese  and  whey  rolled into balls), [7]  and  irimshik  (dried sour milk product similar to  qurt , but not rolled into balls). [10]  These drinks were traditionally consumed with the main course. However, meals often end with  qymyz  and then  tea . [7]  In the summer,  shubat  is one of the staple drinks of the Adai  Kazakhs . [11]   Black tea  was introduced from  China  after the foundation of the  Silk Way  and was traditionally consumed with sweets after the main course. Nowadays it has virtually replaced other traditional drinks and every meal is accompanied with tea. The tea ceremony, taking its roots from the nomads many centuries ago, is a special  dastarqan  ( дастарқан ) ritual in Kazakhstan. Kazakh tea is typically strong black tea with milk or cream.
 
 Desserts [ edit ] 
 This section  needs expansion . You can help by  adding to it .   ( February 2012 ) 
 The most common traditional sweets are  Bawyrsaq ,  shelpek ,  shek-shek  (also known by the Tatar name  chack-chack ), and  zhent  ( жент ). [12]  They are easy to prepare in nomadic conditions - in a cauldron, and today are traditionally prepared for any celebration undoubtedly being an additional decoration of the festive table.
 
 Influential cuisines [ edit ] 
 In addition to traditional nomadic practices and the internal development of Kazakh food and cuisine, other countries and ethnic groups have had a large influence on the food and food culture of Kazakhstan. These ethnic groups included Russians, Tatars, Ukrainians, Uzbeks, Germans, Uyghurs, Koreans, and many more. [13]  Although traditional Kazakh cuisine is based on meat and milk products, more recently, vegetables, fish and  seafood , baked dishes, and sweets have been added to Kazakh cuisine. [7] 
 
 Practice and ritual [ edit ] 
 In  nomadic  cookery, the amount of equipment is minimal because it must be transported from location to location to follow the grazing herds. In addition, there are no luxuries such as electricity or running water. The iron  kazan  is the most indispensable piece of cookware—it is used for cooking  pilaf , soups, and even  bread —if the kazan is shallow, it can be turned over to cook flatbread on the back. Many parts of the sheep and goat are used for holding milk products or for making  cheese .
 The host of the meal cuts the meat themself and gives the best cuts to more honored people or to children. [ citation needed ]  This  meat  is most often eaten with thin boiled pieces of pastry. Sometimes the most honored guest at a meal will receive a cooked head of a ram, which is passed around in ceremonial or ritual practice. [13]  A guest is always given the place of honor and a special welcome in Kazakh practice. [14] 
 Kazakhs traditionally eat at a low table called a  dastarqan . [15]  Kazakhs also maintain a tradition of using beautiful dishware when possible.  Qymyz  is served in wide bowls decorated with silver or in painted cups, and meat is often served on wide platters.  Tea  is steeped in ornate teapots and served in lovely cups. Unusual ingredients such as dried  melon  and small intestines were regularly woven into interesting patterns, and the bread boasted floral designs painted with berry juice. Bigger and deeper bowls are used to serve  dairy products , and small wooden basins are used for making  dough . Further more, each family has their own  wooden spoons , which are cared for and transported in felt and wooden cases, showing their importance in food culture in Kazakhstan. [16] 
 Kazakhs like other Central Asian nations have some special rules of "tea ceremony". Traditionally it is not allowed to pour tea to the brim of the cup called  kese . The less tea is poured the more respect is given to the guest. It is explained by saying that if the host pours too much tea, it looks like he wants the guest to leave sooner. The less tea is poured, the more the host has to pour it over and over again, so that the guest always has hot tea, which shows care for the guest. However, different regions may have different understandings of the amount of "tea with respect".
