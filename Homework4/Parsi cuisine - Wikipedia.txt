 Parsi cuisine  refers to the traditional cuisine of the  Parsis  of  India  and  Pakistan . [1] 
 
 
 Primary meals [ edit ] 
 The basic feature of a Parsi lunch is rice, eaten with  lentils  or a  curry . Curry is made with  coconut  and  ras  without, with curry usually being thicker than  ras . Dinner would be a meat dish, often accompanied by  potatoes  or other vegetable curry.  Kachumbar  (a sharp onion-cucumber salad) accompanies most meals.
 Popular Parsi dishes include:
 
 Chicken Farcha  (Fried chicken appetizer) 
 Dhansak  (Lamb, mutton, goat, chicken or vegetables in a mixed lentil or toor daal gravy served with brown rice) 
 Patra ni Machhi   (Fish - Pomfret or Surmai stuffed heavily with green coconut chutney and wrapped in a banana leaf - steam cooked.) [2] 
 Sali Murghi  (Spicy chicken with fine  fried matchstick potatoes ) 
 Saas ni Machhi  (Yellow rice with  pomfret  fish fillets in white sauce) 
 Kolmi no Patio  (Shrimp in spicy tomato curry) 
 Jardaloo Sali Boti  (Boneless mutton in an onion and tomato sauce with apricots and fried matchstick potatoes) 
 Khichri  (rice with toor daal or moong daal) 
 Tamota ni Ras Chaval  (mutton cutlets with white rice and tomato sauce) 
 Also popular among Parsis, but less so elsewhere, are the typical Parsi  eeda  (egg) dishes, which include  akuri  (scrambled eggs with spices) and the  pora  ("Parsi"  omelette ). Also, vegetables like  okra ,  tomato ,  potato  and others are often cooked with  eggs  on top.
 Traditional breakfasts during the 1930s in Mumbai or in many South Gujarat villages consisted of  khurchan  (offal meats cooked with potatoes in a spicy gravy), and some variant of the ubiquitous  deep-fried, fried or half-fried eggs. In agrarian communities, this would be washed down by copious quantities of coconut toddy, often straight off the tree.
 Although in the not-so-distant past, vegetables were considered a 'poor peoples food', there is a presently a trend towards light eating, no red-meat and even vegetarianism.
 
 Desserts [ edit ] 
 Common desserts include  sev  (vermicelli),  ravo  (sweet semolina pudding) and  malido  (a nutty fudge). Also popular are  faluda  and  kulfi , both of which are adoptions from the cuisines of the  Irani  and  Persian -speaking communities. Wedding feasts traditionally include  Lagan nu Custard .
 
 Snacks [ edit ] 
 Popular parsi snacks include  bhakhra  (deep fried sweet dough),  batasa  (tea biscuits),  dar ni pori  (sweetened lentils stuffed in a light pastry),  doodh na puff  (milk froth) and  khaman na ladva  (dumplings stuffed with sweetened coconut).
