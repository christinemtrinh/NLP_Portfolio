 English cuisine  encompasses the cooking styles, traditions and recipes associated with  England . It has distinctive attributes of its own, but also shares much with wider  British cuisine , partly through the importation of ingredients and ideas from the  Americas ,  China , and  India  during the time of the  British Empire  and as a result of  post-war   immigration .
 Some traditional meals, such as  bread  and  cheese , roasted and stewed meats,  meat  and  game pies , boiled vegetables and broths, and  freshwater  and  saltwater fish  have ancient origins. The 14th-century English cookbook, the  Forme of Cury , [a]  contains recipes for these, and dates from the royal court of  Richard II .
 English cooking has been influenced by foreign ingredients and cooking styles since the  Middle Ages .  Curry  was introduced from the  Indian subcontinent  and adapted to English tastes from the eighteenth century with  Hannah Glasse 's recipe for chicken "currey".  French cuisine  influenced English recipes throughout the  Victorian era . After the rationing of the  Second World War ,  Elizabeth David 's 1950  A Book of Mediterranean Food  had wide influence, bringing  Italian cuisine  to English homes. Her success encouraged other cookery writers to describe other styles, including  Chinese  and  Thai  cuisine. England continues to absorb culinary ideas from all over the world.
 
 
 History [ edit ] 
 Middle Ages [ edit ] 
 Further information:  Medieval cuisine 
   Recipes from  The Forme of Cury  for "drepee", parboiled birds with  almonds  and fried  onions , and "mawmenee", a sweet stew of  capon  or  pheasant  with  cinnamon ,  ginger ,  cloves ,  dates  and  pine nuts , coloured with  sandalwood , c. 1390 
 English cooking has developed over many centuries since at least the time of  The Forme of Cury , written in the  Middle Ages  around 1390 in the reign of  King Richard II . [1]  The book offers imaginative and sophisticated recipes, with spicy  sweet and sour  sauces thickened with bread or quantities of  almonds  boiled, peeled, dried and ground, and often served in  pastry . Foods such as  gingerbread  are described. [2]  It was not at all, emphasises  Clarissa Dickson Wright  in her  A History of English Food , a matter of large lumps of  roast  meat at every meal as imagined in  Hollywood films . [2] 
 Instead,  medieval dishes  often had the texture of a  purée , possibly containing small fragments of meat or fish: 48% of the recipes in the Beinecke manuscript are for dishes similar to stews or purées. Such dishes could be broadly of three types: somewhat acid, with wine, vinegar, and spices in the sauce, thickened with bread;  sweet and sour , with sugar and vinegar; and sweet, using then-expensive  sugar . An example of such a sweet purée dish for meat (it could also be made with fish) from the Beinecke manuscript is the rich,  saffron -yellow " Mortruys ", thickened with egg: [3] 
 
 Take brawn of  capons  &  porke ,  sodyn  &  groundyn ; tempyr hit up with milk of  almondes  drawn with the broth. Set hit on the  fyre ; put to  sigure  &  safron . When hit boyleth, tak som of thy milk, boylying, fro the fyre & aley hit up with  yolkes  of  eyron  that hit be ryght chargeaunt; styre hit wel for quelling. Put therto that othyr, & ster hem togedyr, & serve hem forth as mortruys; and strew on poudr of  gynger . [3] 
 Another manuscript,  Utilis Coquinario , mentions dishes such as "pyany", poultry garnished with  peonies ; "hyppee", a  rose-hip  broth;  and birds such as  cormorants  and  woodcocks . [4] 
 
 Sixteenth century [ edit ] 
 See also:  Tudor food and drink 
 The  early modern  period saw the gradual arrival of printed cookery books, though the very first, the printer  Richard Pynson 's 1500  Boke of Cokery  was compiled from medieval texts. [5]  The next,  A Proper Newe Booke of Cokerye , was published sometime after 1545. [6]   The Secretes of the Reverende Maister Alexis of Piermont  was published in 1558, translated from a French translation of  Alessio Piemontese 's original Italian work on  confectionery . [6]  The number of titles expanded rapidly towards the end of the century to include  Thomas Dawson 's  The Good Huswifes Jewell  in 1585, the  Book of Cookrye  by "A. W." in 1591, and John Partridge's  The Good Hous-wives Handmaide  in 1594. [6]  These books were of two kinds: collections of so-called secrets on confectionery and health remedies, aimed at aristocratic ladies; and advice on cookery and how to manage a household, aimed at women from more ordinary backgrounds, most likely wives of minor aristocrats, clergymen, and professional men. [b] [6] 
 
   Thomas Dawson 's  The Good Huswifes Jewell  was first published in 1585. 
 English tastes evolved during the sixteenth century in at least three ways. [6]  First, recipes emphasise a balance of sweet and sour. [6]  Second,  butter  becomes an important ingredient in sauces, a trend which continued in later centuries. [6]  Third,  herbs , which could be grown locally but had been little used in the Middle Ages, started to replace spices as flavourings. [6]  In A. W.'s  Book of Cookrye , 35% of the recipes for meat stews and sauces include herbs, most commonly  thyme . On the other hand, 76% of those meat recipes still used the distinctly mediaeval combination of sugar and dried fruit, together or separately. [6]  New ingredients were arriving from distant countries, too:  The Good Huswifes Jewell  introduced  sweet potatoes  (from the tropical Americas) alongside familiar medieval recipes. [7] 
 Elinor Fettiplace's Receipt Book , compiled in 1604 (and first published in 1986) gives an intimate view of  Elizabethan  cookery. The book provides recipes for various forms of bread, such as buttered loaves; for apple fritters; preserves and pickles; and a celebration cake for 100 people. New ingredients appear; a recipe for dressing a shoulder of  mutton  calls for the use of the newly available  citrus fruits : [8] [9] 
 
 Take a showlder of  mutton  and being halfe Roasted, Cut it in great slices and save the gravie then take  Clarret wine  and  sinamond  & sugar with a little  Cloves  and  mace  beatne and the peel of an  oringe  Cut thin and  minced  very smale. Put the mutton the gravie and these thinges together and boyle yt between two dishes, wringe the juice of an oringe into yt as yt boyleth, when yt is boyled enough lay the bone of the mutton beinge first Broyled in the dish with it then Cut slices of  limonds  and lay on the mutton and so serve yt in. [9] 
   Pies  have been an important part of English cooking from Tudor times to the present day. 
 Pies  were important both as food and for show; the  nursery rhyme  " Sing a Song of Sixpence ", with its lines "Four and Twenty blackbirds / Baked in a pie. // When the pie was opened, The birds began to sing" refers to the conceit of placing live birds under a pie crust just before serving at a banquet. [10] [11] 
 
 Seventeenth century [ edit ] 
   Robert May 's  The Accomplisht Cook , first published in 1660 
 The bestselling cookery book of the early seventeenth century was  Gervase Markham 's  The English Huswife , published in 1615. It appears that his recipes were from the collection of a deceased noblewoman, and therefore dated back to Elizabethan times or earlier. Women were thus becoming both the authors of cookery books and their readers, though only about 10% of women in England were literate by 1640. Markham's recipes are distinctively different from mediaeval ones; three quarters of his sauces for meat and meat pies make use of a combination of sweet and sour, and he advises: [6] 
 
 When a broth is too sweet, to sharpen it with  verjuice , when too tart to sweet it with sugar, when flat and wallowish to quicken it with orenge and lemmons, and when too bitter to make it pleasant with hearbes and spices. [6] [12] 
 Robert May 's  The Accomplisht Cook  was published in 1660 when he was 72 years old. [13]  The book included a substantial number of recipes for soups and stews, [14]  38 recipes for  sturgeon , and a large number of pies variously containing fish (including sturgeon), meat (including  battalia pie ), and sweet fillings. [15] 
 French influence is evident in  Hannah Woolley 's  The Cooks Guide , 1664. Her recipes are designed to enable her non-aristocratic readers to imitate the fashionable French style of cooking with elaborate sauces. She combined the use of " Claret  wine" [16]  and  anchovies  with more traditional cooking ingredients such as sugar, dried fruit, and vinegar. [16] 
 
 Eighteenth century [ edit ] 
   Tom King's Coffee House  in  William Hogarth 's painting  Four Times of the Day , 1738 
 John Nott 's  The Cooks and Confectioners Dictionary  (1723), still with rather few precedents to go by, chose an alphabetical treatment for its recipes, from  Al  to  Zest . The book covered everything from soups and salads to meat and fish, as well as pastries of many kinds, confectionery, and the making of beer, cider, and wine. Bills of fare are given for each month of the year. [17] 
 James Woodforde 's  Diary of a Country Parson  gives a good idea of the sort of food eaten in England in the eighteenth century by those who were reasonably prosperous. [18]  To welcome some neighbours on 8 June 1781, he gave them for dinner: [19] 
 
 a Couple of  Chicken  boiled and a  Tongue , a Leg of  Mutton  boiled and  Capers  and Batter Pudding for the first Course, Second, a couple of Ducks rosted and green Peas, some  Artichokes , Tarts and  Blancmange . After dinner, Almonds and Raisins, Oranges and Strawberries, Mountain and  Port Wines . Peas and Strawberries the first gathered this year by me. We spent a very agreeable day. [19] 
 Another country clergyman,  Gilbert White , in  The Natural History of Selborne  (1789) recorded the increased consumption of vegetables by ordinary country people in the south of England, to which, he noted,  potatoes , from the  Americas , had only been added during the reign of  King George III : [20] 
 
 Green-stalls in cities now support multitudes in comfortable state, while gardeners get fortunes. Every decent labourer also has his garden, which is half his support; and common farmers provide plenty of beans, peas, and greens, for their  hinds  to eat with their bacon. [20] 
 Hannah Glasse 's  The Art of Cookery made Plain and Easy  was the best-selling cookery book for a century from its publication in 1747. It ran to at least 40 editions, and was widely pirated. [21] 
 
 Nineteenth century [ edit ] 
   How English puddings should look, according to  Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management , 1861 
 English cooking was systematised and made available to the middle classes by a series of popular books, their authors becoming household names. One of the first was  Mrs Rundell 's  A New System of Domestic Cookery , 1806; it went through sixty-seven editions by 1844, selling hundreds of thousands of copies in Britain and America. [22]  This was followed by  Eliza Acton 's  Modern Cookery for Private Families  1845, which  Bee Wilson  has called "the greatest cookery book in our language", but "modern" only in a nineteenth-century sense. [23] 
 An example recipe from Acton's  Modern Cookery for Private Families  is her "Quince Blanc-Mange (Delicious)": [24] 
 
 Dissolve in a pint of prepared juice of  quinces  an  ounce  of the best  isinglass ; next, add ten ounces of sugar, roughly pounded, and stir these together over a clear fire, from twenty to thirty minutes, or until the juice jellies in falling from the spoon. Remove the scum carefully, and pour the boiling jelly gradually to half a pint of thick cream, stirring them briskly together as they are mixed: they must be stirred until very nearly cold, and then poured into a mould which has been rubbed in every part with the smallest possible quantity of very pure salad oil, or if more convenient, into one that has been dipped into cold water. [24] 
 Acton was supplanted by the most famous English cookery book of the Victorian era,  Isabella Beeton 's  Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management , 1861, which sold nearly two million copies up to 1868. [25]  Where Acton's was a book to be read and enjoyed, Beeton's, substantially written in later editions by other hands, was a manual of instructions and recipes, to be looked up as needed. [26]   Mrs Beeton  was substantially plagiarised from authors including  Elizabeth Raffald  and Acton. [27]  The  Anglo-Italian  cook  Charles Elmé Francatelli  became a celebrity, cooking for a series of aristocrats, London clubs, and royalty including  Queen Victoria . His 1846 book  The Modern Cook  ran through 29 editions by 1896, popularising an elaborate cuisine described throughout with French terminology, and offering bills of fare for up to 300 people. [28] [29] 
 Three of the major hot drinks popular in England,  tea ,  coffee , and  chocolate , originated from outside Europe and were already staple items by Victorian times. [30] 
 Catherine of Braganza  brought the Portuguese habit of tea to England around 1660. Initially, its expense restricted it to wealthy consumers, but the price gradually dropped, until by the 19th century  its use was widespread . [31]  Introduced in the 16th century, coffee became popular by the 17th century, especially in the  coffee houses , the first opening in Oxford in 1650. [32] [33]   Hot chocolate  was a popular drink by the 17th century, long before it was used as a food. Chocolate bars were developed and marketed by three English  Quaker -founded businesses,  Joseph Fry's  (1847), [34]   Rowntree's  (1862), [35]  and  Cadbury's  (1868). [34] 
 
 Twentieth century [ edit ] 
 After the First World War, many new food products became available to the typical household, with branded foods advertised for their convenience. Kitchen servants with time to make custards and puddings were replaced with instant foods in jars, or powders that the housewife could quickly mix.  American-style dry cereals  began to challenge the porridge and bacon and eggs of the middle classes, and the bread and margarine of the poor. While wartime shipping shortages had sharply narrowed choice, the 1920s saw many new kinds of fruit imported from around the world, along with better quality, packaging, and hygiene, aided by refrigerators [36]  and  refrigerated ships . Authors in the 1930s such as  Lady Sysonby [37]  drew on recipes from a wide range of countries. [38] 
 
   Issuing a family's weekly  rations  of bacon,  margarine , butter, sugar, tea, and  lard  in 1943 
 Rationing was introduced in 1940  to cope with the shortages caused by the wartime blockade. Foods such as bananas and chocolate became hard to find, while unfamiliar items such as  dried egg ,  dried potato ,  whale meat , [39]   snook  (a South African fish), [40]  and the tinned pork product  Spam  appeared in the national diet. Since butter, sugar, eggs and flour were all rationed, English dishes such as pies and cakes became hard to make from traditional recipes. Instead, foods such as carrots were used in many different dishes, their natural sugars providing sweetness in novel dishes like carrot  fudge . The diet was less than enjoyable, but paradoxically, rationing meant that overall the population was healthier than ever before, and perhaps ever since. [39]  The  Ministry of Food  employed home economists such as  Marguerite Patten  to demonstrate how to cook economically. After the war, Patten became one of the first television cooks, and sold 17 million copies of her 170 books. [41] 
 
   Elizabeth David 's 1950  A Book of Mediterranean Food  changed English cooking with dishes such as  ratatouille . 
 Elizabeth David  profoundly changed English cooking with her 1950  A Book of Mediterranean Food . [42]  Written at a time of scarcity, her book began with "perhaps the most evocative and inspirational passage in the history of British cookery writing": [42] 
 
 The cooking of the Mediterranean shores, endowed with all the natural resources, the colour and flavour of the South, is a blend of tradition and brilliant improvisation. The Latin genius flashes from the kitchen pans. It is honest cooking too; none of the sham Grand Cuisine of the International Palace Hotel [43] 
 All five of David's early books remained in print half a century later, and her reputation among cookery writers such as  Nigel Slater  and  Clarissa Dickson Wright  was of enormous influence. The historian of food  Panikos Panayi  suggests that this is because David consciously brought foreign cooking styles into the English kitchen; she did this with fine writing, and with practical experience of living and cooking in the countries which she wrote about. She deliberately destroyed the myths of restaurant cuisine, instead describing the home cooking of Mediterranean countries. Her books paved the way for other cookery writers to use foreign recipes. Post-David  celebrity chefs , often ephemeral, included  Philip Harben ,  Fanny Cradock ,  Graham Kerr  ("the galloping gourmet"), and  Robert Carrier . [42] [44] 
 
 Stereotypes [ edit ] 
 Main article:  List of English dishes 
 In 1953, Britain's first celebrity chef, Philip Harben, published  Traditional Dishes of Britain . Its chapter titles simply listed "the  stereotypical  stalwarts of the British diet", [45]  from  Cornish pasty  and  Yorkshire pudding  to  shortbread ,  Lancashire hotpot ,  steak and kidney pudding ,  jellied eels ,  clotted cream  and  fish and chips . Panayi noted that Harben began with contradictions and unsupported claims, naming Britain's supposed reputation for the worst food in the world, but claiming that the country's cooks were technically unmatched and that the repertoire of national dishes was the largest of any country's. [45] 
 The sociologist Bob Ashley observed in 2004 that while people in Britain might agree that the core national diet consisted of items such as the full English breakfast, roast beef with all the trimmings, tea with scones, and fish and chips, few had ever eaten the canonical English breakfast, lunch and dinner in any single day, and many probably never ate any item from the list at all regularly. In any case, Ashley noted, the national diet changes with time, and cookery books routinely include dishes of foreign origin. He remarked that a  National Trust  café, whose manager claimed "We're not allowed to do foreign food ... I can't do lasagne or anything like that", [46]  in fact served curry, because "seemingly curry is English". [46]  Anglo-Indian cuisine has indeed been part of the national diet since the eighteenth century. [47] 
 Some English dishes are relatively new and can be dated to the century, and sometimes to the year, of their introduction. Thus  piccalilli  was introduced from India in the 18th century, as recorded by  Hannah Glasse  who gave a recipe for it in 1758. [48]  Conversely, dishes and sauces still considered foreign, such as fish in sweet and sour sauce, have been in English recipe books since the Middle Ages. [3] [49]  Other dishes took their present form only gradually, as with the so-called " full English breakfast ". Breakfasts of this kind are indeed described in later editions of " Mrs Beeton ", but as one of many variations. Thus her list of "Family Breakfasts for a Week in Winter" has for Wednesday something that looks fairly modern: "bread, muffins, butter, brawn, grilled bacon, boiled eggs"; [50]  but on other days less modern-looking breakfasts include mince, mutton cutlets, grilled kidneys, baked fresh herrings, and hash of cold game or poultry, while suggestions for "Family Breakfasts for a Week in Summer" included sardine toast, cold tongue, kedgeree and rissoles, and "Guests' Breakfast (Autumn)" included cold pheasant, game pie, and pressed beef. [50]

 Foreign influence [ edit ] 
   A menu of Simpson's Grand Divan Tavern, London, 1921 showing foreign influences such as hors d'oeuvre,  chicken Marengo and Spanish olives 
 English cookery has been open to foreign ingredients and influence from as early as the thirteenth century, [72]  and in the case of a few foods like sausages from Roman times. [53]  The Countess of Leicester, daughter of  King John  purchased large amounts of  cinnamon , [72]  while  King Edward I  ordered large quantities of spices such as pepper and  ginger , as well as of what was then an expensive imported luxury, sugar. [73]  Dickson Wright refutes the popular idea that spices were used to disguise bad meat, pointing out that this would have been as fatal then as it would be today. She suggests instead that spices were used to hide the taste of salt, which was used to preserve food in the absence of refrigeration. [74] 
 The English celebrity cook Fanny Cradock asserted: "The English have never had a cuisine. Even  Yorkshire pudding  comes from  Burgundy ." [75]  Nicola Humble observed that in  Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management , there are about the same number of recipes from India as from Wales, Scotland and Ireland together. [76]  Panayi created controversy by asserting, with evidence, that  fish and chips  had foreign origins: the fried fish from Jewish cooking and the potato chips from France; the dish only came to signify national identity from about 1930. [77]  French cuisine powerfully influenced English cooking throughout the nineteenth century, and French celebrity chefs such as the Roux brothers and Raymond Blanc continued to do so in twenty-first-century England. [46] 
 
 The role of Empire [ edit ] 
   Receipt  To make a Currey the Indian Way  from  The Art of Cookery  by  Hannah Glasse , 1758, page 101 
 Curry was created by the arrival of the British in India in the seventeenth century, beginning as bowls of spicy sauce used, Lizzie Collingham writes, to add "bite to the rather bland flavours of boiled and roasted meats." [78]  The 1758 edition of Hannah Glasse's  The Art of Cookery  contains what Dickson Wright calls a "famous recipe" [79]  which describes how "To make a currey the Indian way"; it flavours chicken with onions fried in butter, the chicken being fried with  turmeric , ginger and ground pepper, and stewed in its own stock with cream and lemon juice. Dickson Wright comments that she was "a bit sceptical" [79]  of this recipe, as it had few of the expected  spices , but was "pleasantly surprised by the end result" [79]  which had "a very good and interesting flavour". [79] 
 The process of adapting Indian cooking continued for centuries. Anglo-Indian recipes could completely ignore Indian rules of diet, for example by using pork or beef. Some dishes, such as "liver curry, with bacon" were simply ordinary recipes spiced up with ingredients such as curry powder. In other cases like  kedgeree , Indian dishes were adapted to British tastes;  khichari  was originally a simple dish of lentils and rice. Curry was accepted in almost all  Victorian era  cookery books, such as  Eliza Acton 's  Modern Cookery for Private Families  (1845): she offered recipes for curried  sweetbreads  and curried  macaroni , merging Indian and European foods into standard English cooking. By 1895, curry was included in  Dainty Dishes for Slender Incomes , aimed at the poorer classes. [80] 
 Foreign influence was by no means limited to specific dishes. James Walvin, in his book  Fruits of Empire , argues that potatoes, sugar (entirely imported until around 1900 and the growing of  sugar beet ),  tea , and  coffee  as well as increasing quantities of spices were "Fruits of  Empire " [81]  that became established in Britain between 1660 and 1800, so that by the nineteenth century "their exotic origins had been lost in the mists of time" [81]  and had become "part of the unquestioned fabric of local life". [81] [82] 
 
 Indian and Anglo-Indian cuisine [ edit ] 
 Main articles:  Indian cuisine  and  Anglo-Indian cuisine 
   Kedgeree , 1790, became a popular breakfast dish in the 19th century. 
 During the  British Raj , Britain first started borrowing Indian dishes, creating Anglo-Indian cuisine, with dishes such as  kedgeree  (1790) [83]  and  Mulligatawny soup  (1791). [84] [85]   Indian food was served in coffee houses from 1809, [86]  and cooked at home from a similar date as cookbooks of the time attest. The  Veeraswamy  restaurant in  Regent Street , London, was opened in 1926, at first serving Anglo-Indian food, and is the oldest surviving Indian restaurant in Britain. [87]  There was a sharp increase in the number of curry houses in the 1940s, and again in the 1970s. [88] 
 
   Chicken tikka masala , 1970s, [89]  adapted from the Indian  chicken tikka  and now widely considered "a true British national dish." [90] [91] 
 The post-colonial Anglo-Indian dish  chicken tikka masala  was apparently invented in  Glasgow  in the early 1970s, [89] [91]  while  balti cuisine  was introduced to Britain in 1977 in  Birmingham . [92] [93]  In 2003, there were roughly 9000 restaurants serving Indian cuisine in Britain. The majority of Indian restaurants in Britain are run by entrepreneurs of Bangladeshi (often  Sylhetis ) and Pakistani origin. [94] [95]  According to  Britain's   Food Standards Agency , the Indian food industry in the United Kingdom was worth £3.2 billion in 2003, accounting for two-thirds of all eating out, and serving about 2.5 million British customers every week. [94]  Indian restaurants typically allow the diner to combine base ingredients — chicken, prawns or "meat" (lamb or mutton) — with curry sauces — from the mild  korma  to the scorching  phall  — without regard to the authenticity of the combination. The reference point for flavour and spice heat is the  Madras curry  sauce (the name represents the area of India where restaurateurs obtained their spices, rather than an actual dish). Other sauces are sometimes variations on a basic curry sauce: [96]  for instance,  vindaloo  is often rendered as a fiery dish of lamb or chicken [97]  in a Madras sauce with extra  chilli , rather than the  Luso-Indian  dish of  pork  marinated in  wine vinegar  and  garlic , based on a Goan  Portuguese  dish  carne de vinha d'alhos . [98] [99] 
 Indian restaurants and their cuisine in Britain gradually improved from the stereotypical flock wallpaper and standardised menus. One of the pioneers was the  Bombay Brasserie , which opened in Gloucester Road, London, in 1982, serving the kind of food actually eaten in India. Vegetarian Indian restaurants opened in the 1980s in the Drummond Street area of Euston, London. In 1990  Chutney Mary  followed in Chelsea. In 2001, two Indian restaurants in London,  Tamarind  (opened 1995) and  Zaika  (opened 1999) gained  Michelin stars  for the quality of their cooking. [100] 
 Indian cuisine  is the most popular alternative to traditional cooking in Britain, followed by  Chinese  and  Italian  food. [101] [102]  By 2015, chicken tikka masala was one of Britain's most popular dishes. [103] [89] 
 
 Other influences [ edit ] 
   An English  Chinatown , here in  Birmingham 
 Oriental cuisines have become widely available across England.  Chinese cuisine  became established in England by the 1970s, with large cities often having a Chinatown district; the one in London's  Soho  developed between the two world wars, following an informal area in  Limehouse . [104]  Deriving from  Cantonese cuisine , [105]  the food served by Chinese restaurants has been adapted to suit English taste. [106]  From around 1980 onwards,  Southeast Asian cuisines , especially  Thai  and  Vietnamese , began to gain popularity in England. [107] 
 Italian cuisine  is the most popular  Mediterranean cuisine  in England. In its current form, inspired by Elizabeth David, its rise began after 1945. There were some Italian restaurants before World War II, but they mostly served a generalised haute cuisine. Soon after the war, Italian coffee bars appeared, the first places to trade on their Italian identity; they soon started to sell simple and cheap Italian food such as minestrone soup, spaghetti bolognese and pizza. From the early 1960s, the slightly more elegant trattoria restaurants offered "Italian specialities" such as lasagne verde al forno (baked lasagne, coloured with spinach). [108]  Other Mediterranean influences include  Greek   moussaka ,  feta  and  taramasalata ,  Turkish   doner  and  shish  kebabs, and  Middle Eastern   hummus . [109] 
 French cuisine  in England is largely restricted to expensive restaurants, although there are some inexpensive French bistros. [110] 
For many years, English writers including Hannah Glasse in the 18th century and Andrew Kirwan in the 19th century were ambivalent about French cooking. [111]  However, restaurants serving French  haute cuisine  developed for the upper and middle classes in England from the 1830s [112]  and  Escoffier  was recruited by the  Savoy Hotel  in 1890.   Marcel Boulestin 's 1923  Simple French Cooking for English Homes   did much to popularise French dishes. [113] 
 
 Food establishments [ edit ] 
 Cafes and tea shops [ edit ] 
   Cream tea , comprising  tea  taken with  scones ,  clotted cream  and  jam , in  Boscastle 
 The English cafe is a small, inexpensive eating place. A working men's cafe serves mainly fried or grilled food, such as  fried eggs ,  bacon ,  bangers and mash ‚  black pudding ,  bubble and squeak ,  burgers ,  sausages ,  mushrooms  and  chips . These may be accompanied by  baked beans , cooked  tomatoes , and  fried bread . These are referred to as "breakfast" even if they are available all day. [114]  Traditional cafes have declined with the rise of  fast-food  chains, but remain numerous all over the UK. [115] 
 A  tea shop  is a small restaurant that serves soft drinks and light meals, often in a sedate atmosphere. Customers may eat a  cream tea  in Cornish or Devonshire style, [116]  served from a  china  set, and a  scone  with  jam  and  clotted cream . [117] 
 
 Fish and chip shops [ edit ] 
 Fish and chips  is a hot dish consisting of  battered  fish, commonly  Atlantic cod  or  haddock , and  chips . It is a common  take-away food . [118] 
 Western Sephardic Jews  settling in England from the 16th century would have prepared fried fish like  pescado frito , coated in  flour  and fried in oil. [119]  Chips appeared in the Victorian era;  Dickens 's 1859  A Tale of Two Cities  mentions "husky chips of potatoes, fried with some reluctant drops of oil". [120] [121]  Panayi states that fish and chip shops in the 1920s were often run by Jews or Italians. [45]  Despite this, the new dish was popularly attributed to France;  The Times  recorded that "potatoes chipped and fried in the French manner were introduced in Lancashire with great success about 1871." [45] [d]  The  Fish Trades Gazette  of 29 July 1922 stated that "Later there was introduced into this country the frying and purveying of chip potatoes from France ... which had made the fried fish trade what it is today." [45] 
 
 Pub food [ edit ] 
   Pub grub – a  pie , along with a  pint 
 The public house, or  pub , is a famous English institution. In the mid-20th century, pubs were drinking establishments with little emphasis on the serving of food, other than " bar snacks ", such as  pork scratchings , [122]   pickled eggs , salted  crisps , and  peanuts , which helped to increase beer sales. If a pub served meals these were usually basic cold dishes such as a  ploughman's lunch , invented in the 1950s. [123] [124] 
 In the 1950s some British pubs started to offer "a pie and a pint", with hot individual  steak and ale pies  made on the premises by the landlord or his wife. In the 1960s this was developed into the then-fashionable "chicken in a basket", a portion of roast chicken with chips, served on a napkin, in a wicker basket, by the Mill pub at  Withington . [125]  Quality dropped but variety increased with the introduction of  microwave ovens  and  freezer  food. "Pub grub" expanded to include British food items such as  steak and kidney pudding ,  shepherd's pie ,  fish and chips ,  bangers and mash ,  Sunday roast , and  pasties . [126] [127]  The  gastropub  movement of the 21st century, on the other hand, has sought to serve restaurant-quality food, cooked to order from fresh ingredients, in a pub setting; [128]  one pub,  The Hand & Flowers  in  Marlow  has been awarded two  Michelin stars , and several have one star. [129]  In 1964, pubs were serving 9.1% of meals eaten outside the home; this rose rapidly to 37.5% by 1997. [130] 
 
 Vegetarianism [ edit ] 
 Modern Western  vegetarianism  was founded in the United Kingdom in 1847 with the world's first  Vegetarian Society . [131]  It has increased markedly since the end of  World War II , when there were around 100,000 vegetarians in the country. By 2003 there were between 3 and 4 million vegetarians in the UK, [132]  one of the highest percentages in the Western world, while around 7 million people claim to eat no  red meat . [133]  By 2015, 11 of 22 restaurant chains studied by the  Vegan Society  had at least one vegan main course on their menu, though only 6 of these explicitly labelled them as vegan dishes. [134]  Top-end vegetarian restaurants remain relatively few, though they are increasing rapidly: there were some 20 in Britain in 2007, rising to 30 in 2010. [135] 
 
 Quality [ edit ] 
   William Hogarth 's  O the Roast Beef of Old England (The Gate of Calais) , 1748 
 English cuisine in the twentieth century suffered from a poor international reputation. Keith Arscott of Chawton House Library comments that "at one time people didn't think the English knew how to cook and yet these [eighteenth and nineteenth century] female writers were at the forefront of modern day cooking." [136]  English food was popularly supposed to be bland, but English cuisine has made extensive use of spices since the Middle Ages; introduced curry to Europe; and makes use of strong flavourings such as English mustard. It was similarly reputed to be dull, like roast beef: but that dish was highly prized both in Britain and abroad, and few people could afford it; the "Roast Beef of Old England" lauded by  William Hogarth  in his 1748 painting celebrated the high quality of English cattle, which the French at the "Gate of  Calais " (the other name of his painting) could only look at with envy. The years of wartime shortages and rationing certainly did impair the variety and flavour of English food during the twentieth century, but the nation's cooking recovered from this with increasing prosperity and the availability of new ingredients from soon after the Second World War. [137] 
 
   Scrambled Egg and Bacon Ice Cream , as served at  The Fat Duck  restaurant 
 In 2005, 600 food critics writing for the British  Restaurant  magazine named 14 British restaurants among the 50 best restaurants in the world, the number one being  The Fat Duck  in  Bray, Berkshire , led by its chef  Heston Blumenthal . The quality of  London 's best restaurants has made the city a leading centre of international cuisine. [138] 
 Meanwhile, the  list of United Kingdom food and drink products with protected status  (PDO) under  European Union law  has increased rapidly, with 59 items including  Cornish sardines , Yorkshire  Wensleydale cheese  and Yorkshire forced  rhubarb , Fenland celery, West Country lamb and beef and traditional  Cumberland sausage  listed as registered in 2015, and a further 13 including Birmingham  Balti  listed as applied for. [139]  By 2016 there were 12  cheeses from England  with PDO status. [140]

It has previously been suggested that the mild curry was created decades ago in a Glaswegian kitchen by Asian immigrants catering to Western palates.  Mr Sarwar claimed the dish owed its origins to the culinary skills of Ali Ahmed Aslam, proprietor of the Shish Mahal restaurant in Park Road in the west end of the city.

"People like (it) ... sizzling and hot and with the naan bread," said Mohammed Arif, owner of Adil Balti and Tandoori Restaurant, in the Balti Triangle in Birmingham.  Mr Arif claims to be first man to introduce the Balti to Britain – after bringing the idea from Kashmir – when he opened his restaurant in 1977.  He said that before he "recommended the Balti in the UK" in the late 70s, "there was different curry" in Britain, "not like this fresh cooking one".
