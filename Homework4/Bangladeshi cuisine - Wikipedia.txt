 Bangladeshi cuisine  ( Bengali :  বাংলাদেশের রান্না ) is the national cuisine of  Bangladesh . Bangladeshi cuisine has been shaped by the diverse  history  and river-line  geography of Bangladesh . The country has a  tropical monsoon climate . The staple of Bangladesh is rice and fish. [1]  The majority of Bangladeshi people are ethnic Bengali, who follow  Bengali cuisine , with a minority of non-Bengalis with their own unique cuisine. [2] [3] [4]  Bangladeshi food has more meat, especially beef, compared to  West Bengal . [5] [6] 
 
 
 History 
 Bangladeshi cuisine has over time been largely influenced by the  Mughlai cuisine  left behind by the Mughal rulers. This has led Bangladeshi cuisine to include many rich aromatic dishes such as  biriyani  and  korma  that require the use of a large array of spices along with an great deal of  ghee .  Dhaka  being the Mughal capital of the  Bengal Subah  (which includes the modern  Bangladesh  and the Indian states of  West Bengal ) was a major trading center in  South Asia , so many culinary styles from around the world influenced the city's cuisine. After Dhaka became the capital of  East Bengal , the Bangladeshi populace began to adopt the cuisine of the city with many unknown Persian, Turkish and Arabic-influenced dishes becoming popular. [7] 
 The food used to be spiced with black pepper and chui jhal before the arrival of  green chili  from the  Americas . [8] 
 
 Bangaliketa  (etiquette) 
 Bangladeshi people follow certain rules and regulations while eating. It includes warm hospitality and particular ways of serving as well. This is known as  Bangaliketa  ( Bengali :  বাঙালি কেতা ). The culture also defines the way to invite people to weddings and for dinner. Gifts are given on certain occasions.  Bangaliketa  also includes presentation of serving utensils in a proper manner.

 Specialties by region 
 Dhaka 
   Bakarkhani  in Dhaka, Bangladesh Dhakaiya food  is one of the most notable regional cuisines. The rich culinary customs are influenced by  Mughlai ,  Central Asian ,  Armenian ,  Hindustani  and native Bengali cuisines. However, it also has dishes unique to Dhaka. [10]  The  Nawabs of Dhaka  had brought Mughlai cuisine to Bengal, that were wholly retained by Dhaka's culinary community. Due to the high costs of producing Mughlai food, the recipes were limited to the elite classes in colonial India, and slowly expanded as Bangladesh's economy grew. The main focus on lamb, mutton, beef, yoghurt, and mild spices define the taste of the style. Such dishes as kebab; stuffed breads;  kacchi biriyani ; roast lamb, duck, and chicken;  patisapta ; Kashmiri tea; and  korma  are still served at special occasions like  Eid  and weddings. [11] [12]  Due to the high class of the food, using an excess amount of expensive ingredients like ghee, and making the food melt in one's mouth were essential to the feel of the food. [13] 
 Chowk Bazaar  was one of the most famous business and social meeting centres of Dhaka in the  Mughal period . During  Ramadan   Chowk Bazaar  is famous for its  Iftar  items which include  Moghul cuisine  and other traditional items. Almost 500 different types of Iftar are prepared for Holy Ramadan.

[58]  It is a relatively expensive spice in Bangladesh, and the roots are usually more expensive than the stems because of their stronger aroma. The taste is similar to  horseradish . It was use to make a dish hot before chili was imported from the Americas in the 16th century. [8]
