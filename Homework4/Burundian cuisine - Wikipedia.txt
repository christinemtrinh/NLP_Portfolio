   Burundi portal v t e 
 Burundi  is situated in  East Africa  and has a territory full of  mountains ,  savannas  and agricultural fields, with forests in the surrounding rivers and waters.  Agriculture  is spread on 80% of the country's surface and it mainly includes  coffee ,  tea ,  maize ,  beans  and  manioc . Due to these characteristics, Burundi cuisine is very representative of the African culinary culture, as it includes  beans , which are the staple of Burundi cooking, exotic fruits (mainly  bananas ),  plantains ,  sweet potatoes ,  cassava ,  peas ,  maize  and  cereals , like corn and  wheat . [1] 
 A major aspect when discussing Burundian cuisine is based on the economic conditions of the country: the Burundian people usually eat homemade food, from homemade vessels also used for drinking, carrying water and storing  grain .  Food security  remains a major problem in Burundi.
