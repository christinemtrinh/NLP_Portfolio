   Peruvian cuisine — tarateño  sausages and other foods sold by a  street vendor  in  Tarata , Peru 
   Shredded beef 
 South American cuisine  has many influences, due to the ethnic fusion of South America. The most characteristic are Native American, African, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, and  Indian - South Asian . However, there is a mix of  European ,  North American , and indigenous cuisines. [1]  The customs and food products greatly vary [2]  according to the physically distinct regions.
 
 
 Overview [ edit ] 
 The  Amazon basin  of  South America  provides a plethora of fresh fish and  tropical fruits . [3]  The  Pacific Ocean  provides a large amount of  seafood , such as  king crab  (typically caught at the southern end of the continent),  lobster  (found in great quantities from the  Juan Fernández Islands ), and  Antarctic krill , which was recently discovered.  Tuna  and tropical fish are caught all around the continent but are notably found in abundance near  Easter Island . 
 The many plains on this continent make it rich for growing foods like  cereals ,  potatoes  and  quinoa . In the  Patagonia  region in the south of  Argentina , many people raise  sheep  and  cattle . In  Brazil , a traditional dish is  feijoada , a  stew  consisting of  beans  with  beef  and  pork . [ citation needed ]   Rice and beans  is also very common in Brazil. [4] 
 Peruvian cuisine  is largely influenced by traditional  Incan  culture (see  Incan cuisine ). The consumption of  carne asada  is widespread throughout much of the continent. [ citation needed ] [a]   It is popular to grill in the open air as in  asado  or  churrasco . 
 Shredded beef  is common throughout South America and Latin America and is served with a variety of foods. [5] 
 
 By region [ edit ] 
 Andes [ edit ] 
   Pachamanca 
 Main articles:  Argentine cuisine ,  Bolivian cuisine ,  Chilean cuisine ,  Ecuadorian cuisine , and  Peruvian cuisine 
 The food of the Andes is highly influenced by the  indigenous peoples . The principal foods continue to be corn, potatoes [6]  and other  tubers . The meats most characteristic of this zone are the  llama  (Peru) and the  guinea pig  (Chile, Bolivia, Peru, Colombia and the Argentine northwest). In areas where there is fresh water, trout is consumed. 
 Chupe andino  refers to various  stews [7]  and  soups  that are prepared in the Andes mountains region. One of the most important drinks is  chicha . [8]   Important dishes include  humitas ,  locro ,   chanfaina ,  arepas ,  quimbolitos  (dessert tamales), and peppers. A famous dish from the Peruvian Andes is  pachamanca . [9]  From the mixture of German, native cuisine, and the  Chiloé Archipelago  in the southern Andes comes  valdiviano  and  curanto .
 The wetter areas of Peru produce sugar cane, lemon, bananas, and oranges.  Chancaca  is popular as well as  carbonara ,  sancocho ,  huevos quimbos , potato pie, and  ch'arki .
 
 Pampas [ edit ] 
 Main articles:  Argentine cuisine  and  Uruguayan cuisine 
 The  pampas  have the most Italian and Spanish influences. In Argentina, they are the center of the three typical Argentinian dishes  dulce de leche ,  asado  ( churrasco  in Brazil), and  milanesa . 
 Argentine pizza is different from Italian pizza, being closer to  calzones . Pasta and polenta are common in Argentina and on the Pampas generally.  Empanadas  and  choripán  are very popular fast food in Argentina and Uruguay.  Churros ,  ensaïmada ,  alfajor , Spanish tortillas with potato, meatballs,  sopa de mondongo , and  puchero  are Spanish-derived Pampas cuisine.  Mate  is popular on the Pampas. [10] 
 
 Tropical [ edit ] 
 See also:  Brazilian cuisine ,  Colombian cuisine ,  Paraguayan cuisine , and  Venezuelan cuisine 
 The tropical region of the continent is divided into two distinct areas, the coastal areas of the Atlantic and the Pacific and the Amazon area, each with its distinct cuisines. Much of the fruits that are considered to be exotic are common in the tropical forests and fields, such as guava, pineapple, papaya, mango, banana, and elderberry.
 The climate and geography also favour a great variety of crops: potatoes, sweet potatoes,  cassava , complemented with meat and fish; grains, principally rice, corn, and wheat and beans.
 In the coastal area  ceviche ,  tostones  or  patacón ,  arepa ,  chipa ,  sancocho ,  pabellón criollo ,  bandeja paisa ,  guatita , and  sopa paraguaya  are common dishes.
 In Brazilian  feijoada , [11]   arroz carreteiro  (cart riders rice),  coxinha , [12]  and  farofa  are common;  Bahia , a state in Brazil, has its own cuisine which has heavy African influences.
 The Amazon area is known for its utilization of native meats such as the  capybara , turtles,  peccary ,  and  paca . Common dishes are  juane ,  tacacho ,  tacacá . There are a wide variety of fruits native to the Amazon with which a great variety of drinks are prepared.
 
 Diffusion [ edit ] 
 Australia [ edit ] 
 As early as the 1950s, Latin American cuisine have been transported to the Southeast coast, where  Sydney  is. [13]  Now there is a slight selection of Latin American restaurants that has spread across the country.
 
 United States [ edit ] 
 Early South American restaurants in the United States included Caso do Brazil in  Reseda, California , which opened in 1955, [14]  and the Machu Picchu nightclub in  Miami, Florida , which opened in 1963, serving Peruvian dishes such as  ceviche  and  anticuchos . [15]  South American foods are increasingly imported into the United States, especially Brazilian foods such as  guarana ,  guava paste , and  cachaça  (an ingredient in the  caipirinha  cocktail). [16]
