 Australian cuisine  is the food and cooking practices of Australia and its inhabitants. As a modern nation of large-scale immigration, Australia has absorbed culinary contributions and adaptations from various cultures around the world, including British, European, Asian and Middle Eastern.
 Indigenous Australians  have occupied Australia for some 65,000 years, during which they developed a unique  hunter-gatherer  diet, known as  bush tucker , drawn from regional Australian plants and animals. Australia became a  collection of British colonies  from 1788 to 1900, during which time culinary tastes were strongly influenced by British and Irish migrants, with agricultural products such as beef cattle, sheep and wheat becoming staples in the local diet. The  Australian gold rushes  introduced more varied immigrants and cuisines, mainly  Chinese , whilst  post-war immigration programs  led to a large-scale diversification of local food, mainly due to the influence of migrants from the Mediterranean, East Asia and South Asia. [1] 
 Australian cuisine in the 21st century reflects the influence of globalisation, with many fast-food restaurants and international trends becoming influential.  Organic  and  biodynamic  foods have also become widely available alongside a revival of interest in bush tucker. [2]  Australia exports many agricultural products, including cattle, sheep, poultry, milk, vegetables, fruit, nuts, wheat, barley and canola. [3]  Australia also produces  wine ,  beer  and soft drinks.
 While fast food chains are abundant, Australia's metropolitan areas have restaurants that offer both local and international foods. Restaurants which include contemporary adaptations, interpretations or fusions of exotic influences are frequently termed  Modern Australian . [4] 
 
 
 History [ edit ] 
 Indigenous Australian bush food [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Bush tucker 
 Indigenous Australians have lived off  native flora  and  fauna  of the  Australian bush  for over 60,000 years. [5]  In modern times, this collection of foods and customs has become known as bush tucker.
 It is understood that up to 5,000 species of Australian flora and fauna were eaten by Indigenous Australians. [6]  Hunting of kangaroo, wallaby and emu was common, [7]  with other foods widely consumed including  bogong moths ,  witchetty grubs , lizards and snakes. [8]  Bush berries, fruits, and nuts were also used, including the now widely cultivated  macadamia nut , and wild honeys were also exploited. [1]  Fish were caught using tools such as spears, hooks and traps; in some areas, the construction of complex weir systems allowed the development of forms of aquaculture. [9] 
 Resource availability and dietary make-up varied from region to region and scientific theories of bush tucker plants being spread by hand have recently emerged. [10]  Food preparation techniques also varied, however a common cooking technique was for the carcass to be thrown directly on a campfire to be roasted. [11] 
 Native food sources were used to supplement the colonists' diet following the arrival of the  First Fleet  in  Botany Bay  in 1788. [12] [13]

 Development of modern Australian cuisine [ edit ] 
   Tea and damper  - Alfred Martin Ebsworth (1883) 
 Following the  pre-colonial period ,  European colonisers  began arriving with the First Fleet at Sydney harbour in 1788. [14]  The diet consisted of "bread,  salted meat  and tea with lashings of rum (initially from the West Indies but later made from the waste cane of the  sugar industry  in  Queensland )." [15]  The British found familiar game in Australia including swan, goose, pigeon and fish, but the new settlers often had difficulty adjusting to the prospect of native fauna as a staple diet. [1]   Meat constituted a large proportion of the Australian diet during the colonial era and into the 20th Century. [16] 
 After initial difficulties, Australian agriculture became a major global producer and supplied fresh produce for the local market. Stock grazing (mostly sheep and cattle) is prevalent throughout the continent. Queensland and  New South Wales  became Australia's main beef cattle producers, while dairy cattle farming is found in the southern states, predominantly in Victoria. Wheat and other grain crops are spread fairly evenly throughout the mainland states.  Sugar cane  is also a major crop in Queensland and New South Wales. Fruit and vegetables are grown throughout Australia [17]  and wheat is a main component of the Australian diet. [18]  Today there are over 85,681 farm businesses in Australia, 99 percent of which are locally owned and operated. [19] 
 Barbecued meat is almost synonymous with Modern Australian cuisine, though it is estimated that more than 10% of Australians are now vegetarian. [20] [21] 
 After  World War II , subsequent waves of  multicultural  immigration, with a majority drawn from Asia and the Mediterranean region, and the strong, sophisticated food cultures these ethnic communities have brought with them influenced the development of Australian cuisine.
 
   An iconic Modern Australian dish:  Confit of Tasmanian Ocean Trout  at  Tetsuya's ,  Sydney 
 Arguably the first Modern Australian restaurant was Sydney's  Bayswater Brasserie  (est. 1982), which offered Mediterranean dishes with Asian and Middle Eastern influences and "showed Sydney [...] that food can be adventurous without being expensive". [22]   The term itself was first used in print in the 1993 edition of the  Sydney Morning Herald   Good Food Guide , [22] [23]  which placed 34 restaurants under this heading, and was quickly adopted to describe the burgeoning food scene in Sydney in the 1990s. [24]   Leading exponents of the style include  Tetsuya Wakuda  ,  Neil Perry  and  Peter Gilmore . [25] 
 As of 2014, the term is considered somewhat dated, with many restaurants preferring to call their style "contemporary Australian cuisine" instead. [26] 
 
 
 
 Fruit and vegetables [ edit ] 
 Fruit [ edit ] 
   A  Granny Smith  apple 
 There are many species of Australian native fruits, such as  quandong  (native peach),  wattleseed ,  muntries /munthari berry,  Illawarra plums ,  riberry , native raspberries,  lilli pillies , as well as a range of native citrus species including the desert lime and finger lime. [27]  These usually fall under the category of bush tucker, which is used in some restaurants and in commercial preserves and pickles but not generally well known among Australians due to its low availability. [ citation needed ] 
 Australia also has large fruit-growing regions in most states for tropical fruits in the north, and stone fruits and temperate fruits in the south which has a mediterranean or temperate climate. The  Granny Smith  variety of apples originated in Sydney in 1868. [28]  Another well-known Australian apple variety is the  Cripps Pink , known locally and internationally as "Pink Lady" apples, which was first cultivated in 1973. [29] 
 Fruits cultivated and consumed in Australia include apples, banana, kiwifruit, oranges and other citrus, mangoes (seasonally), mandarin, stonefruit, avocado, watermelons, rockmelons, lychees, pears, nectarines, plums, apricots, grapes, melons, papaya (also called pawpaw), pineapple, passionfruit and berries (strawberries, raspberries etc.). [30] 
 
 Vegetables [ edit ] 
 In the temperate regions of Australia vegetables are traditionally eaten seasonally, especially in regional areas, although in urban areas there is large-scale importation of fresh produce sourced from around the world by supermarkets and wholesalers for grocery stores, to meet demands for year-round availability. Spring vegetables include artichoke, asparagus, bean shoots, beetroot, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, cucumber, leek, lettuce, mushrooms, peas, rhubarb, and spinach; summer vegetables include  capsicum , cucumber,  eggplant , squash, tomato, and  zucchini . [31]  Popular dishes include  zucchini slice .
 [32] 
 
 Meat and poultry [ edit ] 
   Chicken parmigiana , colloquially known as a chicken "parma" or "parmi", is a popular  pub food 
 Chicken is the most commonly consumed of all meats or poultry by weight, with approximately 47 kg of chicken consumed by the average Australian per year. [33] 
 
   Sheep grazing in rural Australia. Early British settlers introduced  Western  stock and crops 
 As of July 2018 [update]  Australians ate around 25 kg of  beef  per person with beef having a 35% share of fresh meat sales by value, the highest of any fresh meat in 2018–19. [34] 
 Lamb is very popular in Australia, with roasting cuts (legs and shoulders),  chops , and  shanks  being the most common cuts. Lamb will often form part of either a  Sunday roast  or a barbecue. It is also commonly found as an ingredient in  gyros  and  doner kebabs , brought by Greek and Turkish  immigrants in the 1960s and 1970s. Australia consumes more lamb and mutton than any other country listed by the  OECD - FAO  (with  Kazakhstan  in second place). In 2017, Australians consumed an average of 8.5 kilograms (19 lb) per person. By way of comparison, New Zealanders average 3.2 kilograms (7.1 lb) and Americans just 0.4 kilograms (0.88 lb). [35] 
 Lunch at an  Australian pub  is called a  counter lunch , while the term  counter meal  is used for either lunch or dinner. [36]  Common dishes served at counter lunches and counter meals are steak and chips,  chicken parmigiana  and chips, a mixed grill (an assortment of grilled meats), and roast lamb or beef with roast vegetables. [37] 
 
 Game [ edit ] 
 Kangaroo meat  is available as  game  in Australia, although it is not among the most commonly eaten meats. In colonial-era recipes, kangaroo was treated much like  ox tail , and braised until tender forming a rich gravy. It is available today in various cuts and sausages. [38] [39]  Kangaroo is, however, a common commercial  dog food  in Australia.
 Other less commonly eaten forms of game are  emu  and  crocodile .

 Fish and seafood [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Seafood in Australia 
 Seafood consumption is increasing, but it is less common in the Australian diet than poultry and beef. [18]  
Australian cuisine features Australian seafood such as  southern bluefin tuna ,  King George whiting , Moreton Bay bugs, mud crab,  jewfish , dhufish (Western Australia) and  yabby . Australia is one of the largest producers of abalone and  rock lobster .
 
   Typical serving of  fish and chips 
 Fish and chips  is a take-away food that originated in the United Kingdom and remains popular in Australia. [40]  It generally consists of  battered deep-fried   fish  with  deep-fried chipped  (slab-cut) potatoes. Rather than cod which is more common in the UK, the most popular fish at Australian fish and chips shops, at least in southern Australian states, is  flake  – a fillet of  Gummy shark  (Mustelus antarcticus). [41] 
 Flathead  is also a popular sport and table fish found in all parts of Australia. Barramundi is a fish found in northern Australian river systems.  Bay lobsters , better known in Australia as  Moreton Bay  bugs are common in seafood restaurants, or may be served with steak as "surf and turf". [ citation needed ] 
 The most common species of the aquaculture industry are salmon, tuna, oysters, and prawns. Other food species include  abalone , freshwater finfish (such as  barramundi ,  Murray cod ,  silver perch ), brackish water or marine finfish (such as barramundi,  snapper ,  yellowtail kingfish ,  mulloway ,  groupers ),  mussels ,  mud crabs  and  sea cucumbers . [42] 
 While inland river and lake systems are relatively sparse, they nevertheless provide freshwater game fish and crustacea suitable for dining. Fishing and aquaculture constitute Australia's fifth most valuable agricultural industry after wool, beef, wheat and dairy. [43]  Approximately 600 varieties of marine and freshwater seafood species are caught and sold in Australia for both local and overseas consumption.  European carp , common in the  Murray River  as an  invasive species , is not considered edible by most Australians despite being common in cuisines across Europe.

 Dairy [ edit ]

 Ever since the first British settlement of 1788, Australia has had a dairy industry. [44]  Today, the Australian dairy industry produces a wide variety of milk, cream, butter, cheese and yoghurt products.
 Australians are high consumers of dairy products, consuming on average some 102.4 litres (22.5 imp gal; 27.1 US gal) of milk per person a year, 12.9 kilograms (28 lb) of cheese, 3.8 kilograms (8.4 lb) of butter (a small reduction from previous year, largely for dietary purposes) and 7.1 kilograms (16 lb) of yoghurt products. [45] 
 
 Beverages [ edit ] 
 Tea [ edit ] 
 For most of Australia's history following the arrival of British settlers,  black tea  was the most commonly consumed hot beverage; however, in recent years,  coffee  has overtaken tea in popularity. [46]  Since the 19th Century,  billy tea  was a staple drink for those out in  the Australian bush , such as those working on the land or travelling overland. Boiling water for tea in a  billy  over a camp fire and adding a gum leaf for flavouring remains an iconic traditional Australian method for preparing tea. [1]  Famously, it was prepared by the ill-fated  swagman  in the renowned Australian folksong " Waltzing Matilda ".
 Tea and biscuits or freshly home-baked  scones  are common for  afternoon tea  between friends and family.
 
 Coffee [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Coffee in Australia 
   Pellegrini's Espresso Bar  in central Melbourne opened in 1954 
 Today's Australia has a distinct  coffee culture . The coffee industry has grown from independent cafes since the early 20th century. [ citation needed ]  The  flat white  first became popular in Australia, [ when? ]  and its invention is claimed by a  Sydneysider . [47] [48]  The iconic Greek cafés of Sydney and Melbourne were the first to introduce locally roasted coffees in 1910. [ citation needed ] 
 In 1952, the first  espresso  machines began to appear in Australia and a plethora of fine Italian coffee houses were emerging in Melbourne and Sydney.  Pellegrini's Espresso Bar  and Legend Café often lay claim to being Melbourne's first 'real' espresso bars, opening their doors in 1954 and 1956 respectively. This decade also saw the establishment of one of Australia's most iconic coffee brands,  Vittoria , which remains the country's largest coffee maker and distributor. The brand has existed in Australia since 1958, well before it moved to the US. [49] 
 
   That ubiquitous Australian coffee drink, the  flat white . 
 To this day, international coffee chains such as  Starbucks  have very little market share in Australia, with Australia's long established independent cafés existing along with homegrown franchises such as  The Coffee Club ,  Michel's Patisserie ,  Dôme  in WA, and  Zarraffas Coffee  in Queensland. One reason for this is that unlike with the United States and Asia, Australia for many decades had already had an established culture of independent cafés before coffee chains tried to enter the market. [50] 
 
 Other hot beverages [ edit ] 
 The chocolate and malt powder  Milo , which was developed by  Thomas Mayne  in Sydney in 1934 in response to the  Great Depression , is mixed with cold or hot milk to produce a popular beverage. In recent years, Milo has been exported and is also commonly consumed in Southeast Asia even becoming a major ingredient in some desserts produced in the region. [51]

 Alcohol [ edit ]

 Beer in Australia  has been popular since colonial times.  James Squire  is considered to have founded Australia's first commercial brewery in 1798 and the  Cascade Brewery  in  Hobart, Tasmania , has been operating since the early 19th century. Since the 1970s, Australian beers have become increasingly popular globally – with  Fosters  lager being an iconic export brand. However, Fosters is not a large seller on the local market, with alternatives such as  Victoria Bitter  &  Carlton Draught  outselling the popular export. Craft beer is popular, as well as distinctive products from smaller breweries such as  Coopers  and  Little Creatures . [52] 
 The  Australian wine  industry is the fifth largest exporter of wine around the world, with 760 million litres a year to a large international export market and contributes $5.5 billion per annum to the nation's economy. Australians consume over 530 million litres annually with a per capita consumption of about 30 litres – 50% white table wine, 35% red table wine. [53]  Wine is produced in every state, with more than 60 designated wine regions totalling approximately 160,000 hectares. Australia's wine regions are mainly in the southern, cooler parts of the country, in  South Australia , New South Wales,  Victoria , and  Western Australia . Amongst the most famous wine districts are the  Hunter Region ,  Margaret River ,  Yarra Valley , and  Barossa Valley  and among the best known wine producers are  Penfolds ,  Rosemount Estate ,  Wynns Coonawarra Estate  and  Lindeman's . [54]  In Australia's tropical regions, wine is produced from exotic fruits such as mango, passion fruit and lychees. [55] 
 In modern times, South Australia has also become renowned for its growing number of premium spirits producers, with the South Australian Spirits industry quickly emerging as a world leader with producers being recognised globally such as Seppeltsfield Road Distillers, Never Never Distilling, Adelaide Hills Distilling and many more. [56] [57] 
 Rum served as a currency during the late 18th and early 19th centuries in Australia when metallic currency was in short supply. [58]

 Take-away and convenience foods [ edit ]

 The traditional places to buy  take-away food  in Australia has long been at a local  milk bar ,  fish and chip  shop, or  bakery , though these have met with stiff competition from fast food chains and convenience stores in recent decades.
 Iconic Australian take-away food (i.e.  fast food ) includes  meat pies ,  sausage rolls ,  pasties ,  Chiko Rolls , and  dim sims . Meat pies, sausage rolls, and pasties are often found at  milk bars , bakeries, and petrol stations, often kept hot in a  pie warmer  or needing to be  microwaved ; meat pies are also a staple at  AFL  football matches. [59]  Chiko rolls, dim sims and other foods needing to be  deep fried , are to be found at  fish and chip  shops, which have the necessary  deep fryers  in which to cook them.
 The Australian hamburgers and  steak sandwiches  are also found at  fish and chip  shops. Australian hamburgers consist of a fried beef patty, served with shredded lettuce and sliced tomato in a (usually toasted) round bread roll or bun.  Tomato sauce  (similar to ketchup but made with less sugar and slightly less  viscous ) or  barbecue sauce  are almost always included. Bacon, cheese and fried onions are also common additions, as is a slice of  beetroot  and/or a fried egg, with other options including sliced pineapple.  Pickles  are rarely included, except in burgers from American chains. [60]  Steak sandwiches come with the same options, but instead of a beef patty they consist of a thin steak and are served in two slices of toast, not buns.
 Commonly found at community and fundraising events are  sausage sizzle  stalls – a stall with a barbecue hot plate on which sausages are cooked. At a sausage sizzle the sausage is served in a slice of white bread, with or without tomato sauce and with the option of adding fried onions, and eaten as a snack or as a light lunch. A sausage sizzle at a  polling station  on any Australian state or Federal election day has humorously become known as a  Democracy sausage . [61] 
 The  Halal Snack Pack , ("HSP", also known in South Australia as an AB) originated in Australia as a fusion of  Middle Eastern  and  European  flavours, common at kebab shops around Australia. It consists of  doner kebab  meat served over hot chips and covered in sauces (such as chilli, garlic, or barbecue sauce). [62]

 Baked goods and desserts [ edit ] 
 Damper  is a traditional Australian  soda bread  prepared by  swagmen ,  drovers  and other travellers. It is a wheat flour based bread, traditionally baked in the coals of a campfire.  Toast  is commonly eaten at breakfast. An iconic commercial spread is  Vegemite  – this is a salty,  B vitamin -rich savoury spread made from  brewers yeast  eaten on buttered toast, commonly at breakfast, or in sandwiches. [63] [64]  A common children's treat dating back to the 1920s is  fairy bread . [65] 
 A classic Australian biscuit is the  ANZAC biscuit , which are often homemade and so-called as they were sent by families and friends to Australian soldiers fighting in Europe and the  Dardanelles  in the  First World War . A popular commercial brand of biscuit are  Arnott's   Tim Tams .
 A classic Australian cake is the  lamington , made from two squares of butter cake or sponge cake coated in an outer layer of chocolate sauce and rolled in desiccated coconut. Another popular cake and dessert dish is the  pavlova , a  meringue -based dessert, however the origins of this are contested as New Zealand also lays claim to its invention. [66] [67] 
 The mango pancake, a stable of Yum Cha restaurants in Sydney and elsewhere in Australia, is believed to have originated in Sydney in the late 1980s and early 1990s. [68]

 Regional foods [ edit ] 
   The famous  pie floater  of Adelaide 
 As well as national icons there are many regional iconic foods. [69] 
 South Australia has  FruChocs , King George whiting, and a range of food of German origin including mettwurst, Bienenstich (beesting), streuselkuchen (German cake) [70]  and  fritz . The state has its own iconic brands such as Farmers Union Iced Coffee, YoYo biscuits, Balfours  frog cakes . Jubilee cake is a specialty of South Australia. [71]  In Adelaide, a variant on the meat pie is the  pie floater , which is a meat pie served in a bowl of pea soup.
 Victoria is famous for its home-grown Melbourne invention, the  dim sim . [72]  Melbourne is also the home of the hot jam donut. [73]  Tasmania has leatherwood honey,  abalone, [74]  and  savoury toast . [75]  Queensland has Weis Fruit Bar and claims the lamington. [76] 
 
 Cities [ edit ] 
 Brisbane [ edit ] 
 The  cuisine of Brisbane  derives from mainstream Australian cuisine, as well as many cuisines of international origin. Major native foods of the Brisbane region and commonly used in local cuisine include; the  macadamia ,  lemon-scented myrtle ,  Australian finger lime ,  bunya nut , and  Moreton Bay bug . The city's cuisine culture is often described as casual with an emphasis on outdoor dining. [77]  Roof-top dining has become an iconic part of the culinary landscape, as well as a large  street food  scene with  food trucks  and pop-up bars common. [78]  Brisbane also lays claim to several foods including  "smashed avo" ; [79]  although popularized in  Sydney  in the 1990s, smashed avocado was a common dish in Brisbane and Queensland dating back to the 1920s. [80]  Brisbane also claims the  Lamington  and the Conut.
