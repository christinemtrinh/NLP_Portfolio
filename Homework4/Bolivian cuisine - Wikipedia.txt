   Pique macho , one of the main Bolivian dishes. 
 Bolivian cuisine  is the indigenous cuisine of  Bolivia  from the  Aymara  and  Inca cuisine  traditions, among other  Andean  and  Amazonian  groups. Later influences stemmed from  Spaniards ,  Germans ,  Italians ,  French , and  Arabs  due to the arrival of conquistadors and immigrants from those countries. The  traditional staples of Bolivian cuisine are  corn ,  potatoes ,  quinoa  and  beans . These ingredients have been combined with a number of staples brought by the Spanish, such as  rice ,  wheat ,  beef , and  pork .
 Bolivian cuisine differs by geographical locations. In Western Bolivia in the  Altiplano , due to the high, cold climate cuisine tends to use spices, whereas in the lowlands of Bolivia in the more Amazonian regions dishes consist of products abundant in the region: fruits, vegetables, fish and  yuca . [1] 
 
 
 Influences [ edit ] 
 Bolivian cuisine has been influenced by the  Inca cuisine ,  Aymara cuisine ,  Spanish cuisine , and to a lesser extent the cuisines of other neighboring countries, like  Argentina  and  Paraguay . European immigration to Bolivia is not as common when compared with other Latin American countries, and while German, Italian,  Basque  and other cuisines have influenced the cuisine of Bolivia,  Spanish cuisine  remains the primary influence. [2]

 Sweets [ edit ] 
   Bolivian  salteña 
 Sweets in Bolivia use typical sweeteners like honey and  sugarcane .  Manjar blanco  is a common ingredient used as a filling in place of  dulche de leche  for regional variations of traditional desserts like  alfajores . Sweet fruits like  bananas ,  guava ,  coconut ,  passion fruit , and  raisins  are commonly used, especially coconut which features in numerous dessert preparations like  cocadas ,  budín de coco  (coconut pudding) and  pastelitos .
 Some local fruits like the  achacha  come from the  Amazon , while others still are native to the  Andes . Known as "custard apple" in English, the  cherimoya  fruit, believed to be native to the  Andes , is commonly used to make ice cream and other sweets.  Mark Twain  once described the  cherimoya  as "the most delicious fruit known to men". [2] 
 Helado de canela  is a type of  sorbet  flavored with cinnamon.  Tawa-Tawas  are  fritter  sweetened with  miel de caña . [2] 
 Bunuelos  are fried sweet fritters commonly eaten for breakfast with a sweetened beverage called  api  made with  morocho  corn, cinnamon, milk and sugar. Another breakfast food is the Andean fruit  tamarillo , a common ingredient for  compotes ,  marmalades  and assorted desserts. [2] 
 
 Meal structure [ edit ] 
   Menu in a typical Bolivian inexpensive restaurant:  Económico ,  Cuarto ,  Milanesa de Pollo  and  Locro de Pollo 
 Breakfast ( desayuno ) [ edit ] 
 Although a Bolivian breakfast can be very rich, most Bolivians start their day simply with a black coffee ( cafe tinto ) and a piece of bread.
 
 Lunch ( almuerzo ) [ edit ] 
 Almuerzo  is the most important meal of the Bolivian day, so much so that daily life tends to revolve around it. Long lunches are traditional throughout the country, so businesses and shops often close between the hours of 12 and 2 pm, so that the workers have time to return home for lunch. A typical Bolivian lunch would consist of several courses, including a soup, a main course of meat, rice, and potatoes, then a dessert and coffee. [4]  Lunch is taken at a leisurely pace and is traditionally followed by a nap, the oft-cited  siesta .
 
 Tea ( té ) [ edit ] 
 Bolivians observe an afternoon tea break similar to those in England. Usually the tea breaks take place around 4 and 5 pm at  salones de té  (tearooms). These tearooms often double as bakeries so that tea and pastries are enjoyed together. [5]  Cups of  black tea  are usually taken with  biscuits  such as  galletas Maria  or more traditional  humintas . Often, Bolivians drink  coca  or herbs tea when not having black tea.
 
 Dinner ( cena ) [ edit ] 
 Dinner is a lighter, much more informal affair than lunch that typically takes place at usually 8 pm or later.
