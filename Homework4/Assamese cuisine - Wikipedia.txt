 Assamese cuisine  is the cuisine of the  Indian state  of  Assam . It is a style of cooking that is a confluence of cooking habits of the hills that favour  fermentation  and  drying  as forms of preservation [4]  and those from the plains that provide extremely wide variety of fresh vegetables and greens, and an abundance of fish and meat. Both are centred on the main ingredient — rice.  It is a mixture of different indigenous styles with considerable regional variations and some external influences. The traditional way of cooking and the cuisine of Assam is very similar to South-East Asian countries such as  Thailand ,  Burma  (Myanmar) and others.
The cuisine is characterized by very little use of spices, little cooking over fire, and strong flavours due mainly to the use of endemic exotic fruits and vegetables that are either fresh, dried or fermented. Fish is widely used, and birds like  duck , pigeon,  squab , etc. are very popular, which are often paired with a main vegetable or ingredient;  beef  used to be eaten before British  colonialism , [5]  and some continue to do so. [6]  Preparations are rarely elaborate. The practice of  bhuna , the gentle frying of spices before the addition of the main ingredients so common in Indian cooking, is absent in the cuisine of Assam. [7]  The preferred oil for cooking is the pungent mustard oil.
 
   Kosu xaak aru madhuxuleng (Colocasia with Polygonum microcephalum) 
 A traditional meal in Assam begins with a  khar , a class of dishes named after the main ingredient. Another very common dish is  tenga , a sour dish. Traditionally, both  khar  and  tenga  are not eaten together in the same meal, though it has become common lately. The food is usually served in  bell metal  utensils made by an indigenous community called  Mariya .   Tamul  ( betel nut , raw or fermented) and  paan  generally conclude the meal.
 Though still obscure, this cuisine has seen wider notice in recent times. [8]  The discovery of this cuisine in the popular media continues, with the presenters yet to settle on the language and the specific distinctiveness to describe it. [9] 
 
 
 Ingredients [ edit ] 
 Rice [ edit ] 
 Rice  is the most important ingredient in this cuisine. The large varieties of rice found in the region has led to speculation that the grain was first domesticated in the Assam- Yunnan  region. Both the  indica  as well as the  japonica  varieties are grown in Assam. The most popular class of rice is the  joha  or scented rice. As a staple, rice is eaten either steam boiled ( ukhua ) or sundried ( aaroi ). Some very fine quality of rice namely,  Karaballam  or  kauribadam  etc., are available in Assam only.
 Rice is eaten as snack in many forms: roasted and ground ( xandoh ), boiled in its husk and flattened ( chira ), puffed ( akhoi ).  kumol saul  is rice that is precooked, dried and then husked; it can be simply soaked in warm water and eaten as a light meal.
 Rice is a part of all meals in Assam. A traditional breakfast consists of  chira  with  yogurt  and  jaggery . Mostly farmers eat cooked rice soaked overnight ( poita ) simply accompanied with salt,  mustard oil ,  onions , etc. Snacks are  xandoh ,  kumol saul  or  bora saul , sticky rice, which can be eaten with sweet or salty accompaniments. For other major meals, rice could be boiled, steamed or wrapped in leaves and roasted. 'Sunga Saul' is a special preparation in which (sticky) rice ( bora saul ) is cooked in bamboo hollows called 'sunga'. 'Sewa diya Bhaat' is another preparation where sticky rice is steamed over boiling water. They are generally served with meat or fish. Sticky rice is also wrapped in leaves, usually plantain leaves or  tora pat , and dropped into boiling water to prepare 'tupula bhat'.
 A special class of rice preparations, called  pithas  are generally made only on special occasions like the  Bihu . Made usually with soaked and ground glutinous rice ( bora saul ), they could be fried in oil with a  sesame  filling ( xutuli pitha ), roasted in young green bamboo over a slow fire ( sunga pitha ) or baked and rolled over a hot plate with a filling ( kholasaporia pitha ).
 
 Fish [ edit ] 
   Masor Tenga 
 The next most important ingredient is fish, harvested from the many rivers, ponds and lakes in the region. The extremely wet climate and the large numbers of water bodies has ensured that large varieties of fresh water fish are available in abundance in the valley. It is a staple item in the Assamese palate. There is no traditional ethnic community in Assam that does not eat fish. Most traditional rural households have their own ponds for  pisciculture . Some of the most popular big fishes are the  Borali  (freshwater dhark),  rou , and  cital  (big),  khoria  (medium) ( Chitala chitala ),  maagur ,  Xingi ,  borali ,  bhokua  or  bahu ,  Xaal ,  Xol , etc. The small varieties of fish available and eaten in Assam like  puthi  ( Swamp barb ),  Ari  (long-whiskered catfish),  Goroi  (green snake head/  spotted snake head),  Koi  or  Kawoi  (climbing perch  Anabas testudineus ),  Kholihona  (Indian paradise fish  Ctenops nobilis )  borolia ,  mua ,  ceniputhi ,  tengera ,  lachin ,  bhangun ,  pabho , etc. [10] [11]  The discerning gourmet can tell which region of Assam is known for which variety of fish. 
 
   Puthi maas  ( Swamp barb ) 
 The  mas tenga  (sour fish), which is commonly eaten by most communities of Assam, has lately turned into a signature dish of Assamese cuisine. The most popular souring agent for the  tenga  is  tomatoes , though ones made with  kajinemu  juice (thick skinned elongated  lemon ) and  thekera  (dried  mangosteen ), Ou-tenga, Teteli,  Kordoi Tenga(South-East Asian Starfruit) ,  Tengamora (Roselle leaves) are also popular.
 The most common way of eating fish in traditional Assamese homes is by preparing a stew with herbs, vegetables, and greens as per preference and availability. Fish is also prepared by roasting or char-grilling. A common favourite dish is a small fish roasted in banana leaves ( paatotdia ).  Hukoti  is a special fish dish prepared from dried small fish like ( puthi maas ) pounded with arum stem and dried and stored in bamboo tubes. Variations of this exist among the ethnic communities of northeast India in general and Assam in particular. Dried and fermented small fish  puthy mas  ( Ticto barb ), three to four in number, are roasted with lavish amounts of green chilis, tomatoes,  ginger  and  garlic  (all roasted). The ingredients are then pounded in a mortar to make a coarse paste and served with rice. Fish eggs and innards are also cooked and consumed. Petu bhoja (fried fish intestines) is also considered a delicacy along with the traditional Assamese Jal, which is an herbal fish curry made with medicinal herbs like bhedailota (Chinese fever vine), noroxingho (curry leaves), bon dhunia, man dhunia, manimuni (Asiatic Pennywort), tengesi leaves, and more. It is known for its rich flavour and medicinal and antioxidant qualities.

 Meat [ edit ] 
   
 The Assamese meat and fish dishes are characterized by a low amount of spices and oil, higher quantity of ginger, noroxinghow paat ( curry leaves ), Khorisa (fermented bamboo shoot) and lemon juice, and differ completely in taste from the dishes of neighboring Bengal and are quite similar to the cuisines of nearby South-East Asian and East Asian countries.  Chicken ,  Venison ,  Squab ,  Mutton ,  Duck  and  Pork  is very popular among the indigenous ethnic Assamese communities like  Sonowals ,  Bodo ,  Rabha ,  Keot (Kaibarta) ,  Ahom , Moran,  Sutiya  etc. Upper caste Assamese Hindus, such as  Assamese Brahmins (including Ganaks)  and  Kayasthas of Assam ,  Kalitas  of Lower Assam refrain from pork consumption.  Beef  is occasionally consumed by  Assamese Muslims , although they traditionally refrain from consuming pork. The  Christians , many indigenous Assamese communities, and the  non religious  sections consume all types of meat.
 The basic cooking methods include cooking, shallow and deep frying.  Onla , of the  Bodos , is made with ground rice and special  herbs  and constitutes a complete meal in itself. Other meats include  squab ,  duck ,  chicken ,  goat meat ,  venison , and  turtle  although  venison  and  turtle  meat are legally prohibited. The combination of  duck / white gourd  and  squab / papaya  or
 banana flower  is very popular. Meat is generally stewed using limited spices as well as a choice of herbs and vegetables.
 Most communities of Assam are entomophagous. Various indigenous ethnic groups of certain areas partake of the silkworm, water bugs, grasshoppers, and other insects. Insects are fried or cooked or roasted in leaves and then prepared according to the timing of the meal. The red  ant eggs  ( amroli poruar tup ) is considered a delicacy during the  Rongali Bihu  festival.
 
 Green vegetables [ edit ] 
 Main article:  List of vegetables used in Assamese cuisine 
 The environs of  Assam  are rich in vegetation, and green leafy  vegetables , called  xaak , are an important part of the cuisine. Some of them are grown while others like the  dhekia  ( fern ) grows wild. There is a bewildering variety that is eaten and according to custom, one has to have 101 different  xaak  (greens) during  Rongali Bihu . Herbs, greens, and vegetables are commonly eaten by simply cooking in water and salt, lightly frying, as a thick soup or by adding to varieties of lentils. They are also prepared in combination with fish, meat and eggs.
 
 Spices of Assam [ edit ] 
 Among spices there are  ginger ,  garlic ,  onion ,  cumin seed ,  black cumin ,  black pepper ,  chilli ,  turmeric ,  coriander seed ,  cinnamon ,  cardamom ,  clove ,  fenugreek seed ,  white mustard  seed,  aniseed ,  Malabar leaf , etc. Some herbs peculiar to Assam are  maan dhaniya ,  moran Ada ,  madhuhuleng ,  bhedai lota ,  manimuni ,  masundari ,  tengesi ,  thekera ,  kordoi ,  outenga ,  tengamora':  etc. An Assamese meal is incomplete without green chilis, many varieties of which are available in the region. Assam is famous for the  bhut jolokia  or  ghost pepper, which was recognized as the hottest chili in the world.  Panch-furan  (mixture of 5 spices) is used for adding flavour to Dail. Dail was not originally eaten by the indigenous people of Assam, but has slowly been adopted and adapted to local preferences due to external influences.
 
 Preparations [ edit ] 
 Although the modern cuisine of Assam has been influenced to a small extent by East and North Indian cuisine,  Assam  is still rich in traditional dishes which are similar to the cuisines of East Asian and South-East Asian nations.
 
 Khar [ edit ] 
   An Assamese 'khar'(Kharwai-a traditional  Kachari tribe  dish) recipe preparation with rohu fish head 
 The khar is a signature class of preparations made with a key ingredient, also called khar. The traditional ingredient is made by filtering water through the ashes of the sun-dried skin of a few varieties of  banana , which is then called  kola khar  (The name derived from the local term for banana, "kol" or "kola.") A traditional meal invariably begins with a  khar  dish, which can be prepared with raw  papaya , mustard leaves, vegetables,  pulses , fish or any other main ingredient.
 Xôkôta is a severely bitter type of preparation. It is prepared with dry  jute  leaf,  urad bean  and  khar . However, the combination of  khar  (alkaline) and  tenga  (acidic) is not recommended. The liquid khar is also simply eaten as  kharoli  with rice which is prepared by adding a few drops of mustard oil. Assamese people have a peculiar tradition of eating a large variety of bitter dishes, many of which are considered delicacies. Some dishes in this category include,  fresh bamboo shoot , cooked or lightly fried,  cane shoot ,  Neem  leaves fried,  titabhekuri ,  bitter gourd ,  Xukuta ,  Titaphool ,  Sewali Phool  etc.

Fish is fried in  mustard oil  or stewed with  bottle gourd  or  spinach  or boiled simply. Another  tenga  dish is prepared with  matimah  ( urad bean ) and  outenga  ( elephant apple ).  Bottle gourd  can be added to it.  Tengamora  ( Roselle (plant) ) or  noltenga  ( Indian chestnut vine ) and  lentil  is a distinct  tenga   curry .
