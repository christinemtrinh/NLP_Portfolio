 Culinary traditions of Seychelles 
   The location of  Seychelles 
 Seychellois cuisine  is the  cuisine  of the  Republic of Seychelles , an  archipelago  country consisting of 115  islands .  Fish  plays a prominent part in country's cuisine [1]  because of its location in the  Indian Ocean . The Seychelles's cuisine has been influenced by  African ,  British ,  French ,  Spanish ,  Indian  and  Chinese cuisines . [2] [3] 
 The use of  spices  such as  ginger ,  lemongrass ,  coriander  and  tamarind  are a significant component of Seychellois cuisine. [3]  Fresh fish and fruits are sold by  street vendors  in various places. [1]

[1] [3]  Fish dishes are cooked in several ways, such as  steamed ,  grilled , wrapped in  banana leaves ,  baked ,  salted [4]  and  smoked .

[7]  The savory dish usually includes salted fish, cooked in a similar fashion to the dessert version, with plantain, kasava and breadfruit, but with salt used in place of sugar (and omitting vanilla).
