   Some of the popular Pashtun dishes, from left to right: 1.  Mutton  grilled kebab ( seekh kabab ); 2.  Palao  and salad; 3.  Tandoori chicken ; and 4.  Mantu  (dumplings). The Pashtun cuisine includes a blend of Central Asian, South Asian and Middle Eastern cuisines. Most Pashtun dishes are traditionally non-spicy. 
 Pashtun cuisine  ( Pashto :  پښتنۍ خواړه ) refers to the cuisine of the  Pashtun  people and is covered under both  Afghan  and  Pakistani cuisines . It is largely based on meat dishes including  mutton , beef, chicken, and fish as well as rice and some other vegetables. [1]  Accompanying these staples are dairy products (yogurt, whey, cheeses), various nuts, local vegetables, and fresh and dried fruits.  Peshawar ,  Kabul ,  Kandahar ,  Quetta  and  Islamabad  are centers of Pashtun cuisine.
