 Punjabi cuisine  is a  culinary  style originating in the  Punjab , a region in the northern part of  South Asia , which is now divided in an  Indian part  to the east and a  Pakistani part  to the west. This cuisine has a rich tradition of many distinct and local ways of cooking. One is a special form of  tandoori  cooking that is now famous in other parts of Pakistan and India, England, Canada, America, and in many other parts of the world.
 The local cuisine of Punjab is heavily influenced by the  agriculture  and  farming  lifestyle prevalent from the times of the ancient  Indus Valley civilization . [ citation needed ]  Locally grown  staple foods  form the major part of the local cuisine. Distinctively Punjabi cuisine is known for its rich, buttery flavours along with the extensive vegetarian and meat dishes. Main dishes include  sarson dā saâg  (a stew whose main ingredient is mustard greens) and  makki di roti  (flatbreads made with cornmeal).
 Karrhi is a spicy, yellow gravy with cakes made of chickpea flour (besan), containing lemon juice, red pepper and turmeric. It is commonly served with rice or naan.
 Basmati  rice is the indigenous variety of Punjab, and various meat- and vegetable-based rice dishes have been developed using it. [1] [2] [3]

According to Planalp (1971), "the Panjab-style underground oven known as tandur is becoming increasingly popular in New Delhi" pointing to the Punjabi style of the tandoor.

 Tandoor [ edit ] 
 Further information:  Tandoor  and  Punjabi tandoori cooking 
 According to  Ancient Pakistan - An Archaeological History  by Mukhtar Ahmed, [53]  Harappan oven structures may have operated in a similar manner to the modern tandoors of the Punjab. The tandoor is traditionally made of clay and is a bell-shaped oven, set into the earth and fired with wood or charcoal reaching high temperatures. According to Roy Hayter [54]  the original versions of the tandoor "in the Punjab, a province in the north-west of India, were sunk neck deep in the ground". He further states that modern versions can also rest above the ground.
 
 Modern methods [ edit ]

 Iron griddle 
 Etiquette of Punjabi dining [ edit ] 
 Etiquette of eating is considered a major part of the cuisine. Every Punjabi household follows certain regional  etiquette . The word etiquette has many local names depending on the particular region of Punjab. Though certain etiquette varies regionally, there are many etiquette practices that are common throughout Punjab.  Communal dining  is a norm in Punjabi families.
 Bringing and sending fresh fruits, sweets and food items as gifts to family members is a common practice in Punjab, particularly during the  spring season . Food items are distributed among neighbors as well on special occasions and as a sign to show hospitality.  Mango  is considered a delicacy and produced widely in Punjab, [55]  and mango parties are common during the fruit's harvest season.  Watermelon  and  radish  at food stalls are shared among friends and relatives.
