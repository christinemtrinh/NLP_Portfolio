 Romanian cuisine  ( Romanian :  Bucătăria românească ) is a diverse blend of different dishes from several traditions with which it has come into contact, but it also maintains its own character. It has been mainly influenced by  Turkish  and a series of European cuisines in particular from the  Balkans , or  Hungarian cuisine  as well as culinary elements stemming from the cuisines of  Central Europe . [1] 
 Romanian cuisine includes numerous holiday dishes arranged according to the mentioned season and holiday since the country has its roots in the  Eastern Orthodox Church . Romanian dishes consist of vegetables, cereals, fruits, honey, milk, dairy products, meat and game. [1] 
 Multiple different types of dishes are available, which are sometimes included under a generic term; for example, the category  ciorbă  includes a wide range of soups with a characteristic sour taste. Variations include meat and vegetable soup, tripe ( ciorbă de burtă ) and calf foot soup, or fish soup, all of which are soured by  lemon juice ,  sauerkraut  juice ( zeamă de varză ),  vinegar , or  borș  (traditionally made from bran). The category  țuică  (plum brandy) is a  name for a strong  alcoholic spirit  in  Romania .
 
 
 History [ edit ] 
 See also:  History of Romania 
 In the history of Romanian culinary literature,  Costache Negruzzi  and  Mihail Kogălniceanu  were the compilers of a cookbook "200 rețete cercate de bucate, prăjituri și alte trebi gospodărești" (200 tried recipes for dishes, pastries and other household things) printed in 1841. [2]  Also, Negruzzi writes in "Alexandru Lăpușneanu", "In  Moldavia , at this time, fine food wasn't fashioned. The greatest feast only offered a few types of dishes. After the borș, Greek dishes would follow, boiled with herbs floating in butter, and finally cosmopolitan steaks". [3] 
 Cheese has been a part of Romanian cuisine since  ancient history .  Brânză  is the generic term for  cheese  in Romanian; it is originally a  Dacian  word. Traditional Dacian cuisine included vegetables ( lentils ,  peas ,  spinach ,  garlic ) and fruits ( grapes ,  apples ,  raspberries ) with high nutritional values. [4]  The Dacians produced  wine  in massive quantities.  Burebista , a Dacian king, angered by the wine abuse of his warriors, cut down the vines. As such, his people gave up drinking wine. [5]   Legend says that the Dacian people created their own beer. [ citation needed ] 
Romans helped introduce different pastries made with cheese, including  alivenci ,  pască , or  brânzoaice . They also introduced different variations of  millet   porridge .
 Maize  and  potatoes  became staples of Romanian cuisine after their introduction to  Europe . Maize, in particular, contributed to health and nutrition improvements of Romanians in the 16th and 17th centuries, resulting in a population boom. [ citation needed ] 
 For about three centuries, Wallachia and Moldavia, the two medieval Romanian principalities, were mildly influenced by their various neighbors, like the  Ottoman Empire .  Ottoman cuisine  changed the Romanian table with appetizers made from various  vegetables , such as  eggplant  and  bell peppers , as well as various  meat  preparations, such as  chiftele  (deep-fried meatballs, a variation of  kofta ). The various kinds of  ciorbă   and meat-and-vegetable stews, such as  iahnie de fasole  (beans),  ardei umpluți  (stuffed peppers), and  sarmale  (stuffed cabbage) are influenced by  Turkish cuisine . The Romanian tomato salad is a variation of the Turkish  çoban salata . [ citation needed ] 
 
 Description [ edit ] 
 Romanian recipes bear the same influences as the rest of Romanian culture. The Turks brought  meatballs  ( perișoare  in a meatball soup), from the Greeks there is  musaca , from the Austrians there is the  șnițel , and the list continues. The Romanians share many foods with the Balkan area  and former Austria-Hungary. Some others are original or can be traced to the Romans, as well as other ancient civilizations. The lack of written sources in Eastern Europe makes it impossible to determine today the exact origin for most of them.
 One of the most common meals is the  mămăligă , the precursor of  polenta , served on its own or as an accompaniment.  Pork  is the main meat used in Romanian cuisine, but also  beef  is consumed and a good lamb or fish dish is never to be refused.
 Before  Christmas , on December 20 (Ignat's Day or  Ignatul  in  Romanian ), [6]  a  pig  is traditionally sacrificed by every rural family. [7]  A variety of foods for Christmas are prepared from the slaughtered pig, such as:
 
 Cârnați  – garlicky pork sausages, which may be smoked or dry-cured; 
 Lebăr  – an emulsified sausage based on  liver  with the consistency of the filling ranging from fine ( pâté ) to coarse; 
 Sângerete  ( black pudding ) – an emulsified sausage obtained from a mixture of pig's blood with fat and meat, breadcrumbs or other grains, and spices; 
 Tobă  (head cheese) – based on pig's feet, ears, and meat from the head suspended in  aspic  and stuffed in the pig's stomach; 
 Tochitură  – a stew made with pork, smoked and fresh sausage simmered in a tomato sauce and served with  mămăligă  and  wine  ("so that the pork can swim"). There are many variations of this stew throughout Romania, with some versions combining different meats, including chicken, lamb, beef, pork and sometimes even offal; 
 Pomana porcului —pan-fried cubed pork served right after the pig's sacrifice to thank the relatives and friends who helped with the process; 
 Piftie / răcitură  – inferior parts of the pig, mainly the tail, feet, and ears, spiced with garlic and served in aspic; 
 Jumări  – dried pork remaining from rendering of the fat and tumbled through various spices 
 The Christmas meal is sweetened with the traditional  cozonac , a sweet bread made with nuts, poppy seeds, or  rahat  (Turkish delight).
 At  Easter ,  lamb  is served: the main dishes are  borș de miel  (lamb sour soup), roast lamb, and  drob de miel  – a Romanian-style lamb  haggis  made from minced  offal  (heart, liver, lungs), lamb meat and spring onions with spices, wrapped in a  caul  and roasted. [8] [9]  The traditional Easter cake is  pască , a pie made from  yeast  dough with a sweet  cottage cheese  filling at the center. [10] [11] 
 Romanian pancakes, called  clătite , are thin (like the French  crêpe ) and can be prepared with savory or sweet fillings:  ground meat ,  cheese , or  jam . Different recipes are prepared depending on the season or the occasion. [12] 
 Wine  is the preferred drink, and  Romanian wine  has a tradition of over three millennia. [12]  Romania is currently the world's ninth largest wine producer, and recently the export market has started to grow. [12]  Romania produces a wide selection of domestic varieties ( Fetească ,  Grasă ,  Tămâioasă ,  Busuioacă , and  Băbească ), as well as varieties from across the world ( Italian Riesling ,  Merlot ,  Sauvignon blanc ,  Cabernet Sauvignon ,  Chardonnay , and  Muscat Ottonel ).  Beer  is also highly regarded, generally  blonde pilsener beer , made with German influences. There are also Romanian breweries with a long tradition.
 According to the 2009 data of  FAOSTAT , Romania is the world's second largest  plum  producer (after the  United States ), [13]  and as much as 75% of Romania's plum production is processed into the famous  țuică , a plum brandy obtained through one or more  distillation  steps. [14] 
 
 Vegetarianism and veganism [ edit ] 
 Followers of the  Romanian Orthodox Church  keep  fast  during several periods throughout the ecclesiastical calendar amounting to a majority of the year. In the Romanian Orthodox tradition, devotees keep to a diet without any animal products during these times. As a result, vegan foods are abundant in stores and restaurants; however, Romanians may not be familiar with a vegan or vegetarian diet as a full-time lifestyle choice. [15]  Many recipes below have  vegan  versions, and the Vegetables section below contains many common fasting foods.
