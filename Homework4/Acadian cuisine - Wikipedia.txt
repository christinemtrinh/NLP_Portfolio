 Acadian cuisine  ( French :  Cuisine acadienne ) comprises the traditional dishes of the  Acadian people . [1] [2] [3]  It is primarily seen in the present-day cultural region of  Acadia . Note 1  Acadian cuisine has been influenced by the  Deportation of the Acadians , proximity to the ocean, the  Canadian winter , bad soil fertility, the  cuisine of Quebec ,  American cuisine , and  English cuisine , among other factors.
 Acadian cuisine is not very well known in Canada or internationally. It has much in common with  Québécois cuisine  because of its geographical proximity. The two often feature the same dishes, but the cuisine of Acadia puts more emphasis on  seafood . Acadian cuisine has notably served as the base for  Cajun cuisine  because the  Cajun  are descendants of Acadians who were  deported  to  Louisiana . Note 2 [4]  It is also believed that Acadians are responsible for normalizing  potato  consumption in  France —a vegetable the  French  once considered poisonous.
 
 
 History [ edit ] 
 In the 17th century, French colonists who settled on lands they named  Acadia  adapted their 16th-century  French cuisine  to incorporate the crops, seafood and animals that flourished in the region. Their descendants became the Acadian people and their ingenuity created Acadian cuisine.
 After the  English   conquered Acadia  during the 18th century, they decided to  deport the Acadians  and take their settlements, which were often built on the most fertile earth in the colony. Most Acadians did not manage to escape the deportation. But, of those who did, most fled to the east and north of  New Brunswick Note 3 . As such, Acadian cuisine in the 18th century was refocused around what could be grown, hunted and fished in the less fertile lands of the East Coast of New Brunswick and the  Upper St. John River Valley . [5]

 Acadian cuisine often features fish and seafood, especially  cod  and  Atlantic herring , but also  mackerel ,  berlicoco ,  lobster ,  crab ,  salmon ,  mussels ,  trout ,  clams ,  flounder ,  smelt  and  scallops . Most fish is consumed fresh, but some are  boucané  (smoked), marinated or salted.
 The most commonly used meat is  pork , followed by  chicken  and  beef . As with the rest of  North America ,  turkey  is commonly consumed during the Holidays. Game like  deer ,  hare ,  ruffed grouse  and  moose  is consumed regularly in some regions. Game will replace livestock meat if present and can be given as a gift. In some regions, for example  Caraquet  and the  Îles-de-la-Madeleine , more unusual game is or was caught like  seal ,  bear  and  seagull .
 The vegetables of Acadian cuisine are the  potato ,  onion ,  carrot ,  turnip ,  legume ,  beet ,  squash  and  corn . These vegetables were popular because they were easily  preserved  for the winter in  root cellars  and jars. The  fiddlehead  fern was introduced to the Acadians by the indigenous  Maliseet ,  Mi'kmaq  and  Penobscot  peoples in the early 18th Century and remains a popular Acadian dish. 
 Popular fruits include  blueberries ,  apples ,  strawberries ,  raspberries ,  blackberries ,  plums ,  pears  and  cranberries .
 Some ingredients like  rice ,  molasses , dried  raisins  and  brown sugar  are part of Acadian cuisine because of historical commerce between Acadia and regions like the  Antilles  and  Brazil .  Maple sugar  is also a popular sweetener, given the often-close familial ties between  Quebec  (the world's largest producer of maple sugar) and Acadia.

 Notes [ edit ] 
 1. ^   When one speaks about Acadia before the Deportation of the Acadians, they are referring to the  Acadia  colony owned by France, which is today the  Maritime region  of Canada. When one refers to Acadia in the present tense or after the Deportation of the Acadians, they are referring to the regions where Acadians live today. The  Acadia of today  is the north and east of New Brunswick, and some small parts of  Prince Edward Island  and  Nova Scotia . Acadia, while not always recognized as such, can be considered a nation because of the language, culture, institutions, symbols, territory and history its people share. [ citation needed ] 
 2. ^   Louisiana is not the only place outside of Canada where many people of Acadian descent can be found; there is also  France , the  Falkland Islands , the  Antilles ,  New England  and  Texas . [ citation needed ] 
 3. ^   A few Acadians also fled to sections of  Cape Breton , western Nova Scotia and south Prince Edward Island. Because of their relative distance from New Brunswick, these communities experienced their own challenges and developed some unique dishes. Some also escaped to  New France  (now Québec) and assimilated to the  Canadien  population. [ citation needed ]
