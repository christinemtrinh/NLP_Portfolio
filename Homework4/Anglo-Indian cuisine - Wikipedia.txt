 Anglo-Indian cuisine  is the  cuisine  that developed during the  British Raj  in India. [1]  It was brought to England in the 1930s by the  Veeraswamy  restaurant, followed by a few others, but not by typical  Indian restaurants . The cuisine introduced dishes such as  kedgeree ,  mulligatawny  and pish pash to English palates. One of the few Anglo-Indian foods that has had a lasting impact on  English cuisine  is  chutney .
 Anglo-Indian cuisine was documented in detail by the English colonel  Arthur Robert Kenney-Herbert , writing as "Wyvern" in 1885 to advise the  British Raj 's  memsahibs  what to instruct their Indian cooks to make. [1] [2]  Many of its usages are described in the "wonderful" [1]  1886 Anglo-Indian dictionary,  Hobson-Jobson . [1]  More recently, the cuisine has been analysed by Jennifer Brennan in 1990 and David Burton in 1993. [1] [3] [4] [5] 
 
 
 History [ edit ] 
 During the  British rule in India , local British officials began mixing Indian dishes with their British palates and creating Anglo-Indian cuisine, with dishes such as  kedgeree  (1790) [6]  and  mulligatawny soup  (1791). [7] [8]  The first Indian restaurant in England, the  Hindoostane Coffee House , opened in 1809 [9]  in London; as described in  The Epicure's Almanack  in 1815, "All the dishes were dressed with curry powder, rice, Cayenne, and the best spices of Arabia. A room was set apart for smoking hookahs with oriental herbs". [10]  Indian food was cooked at home from a similar date as cookbooks of the time, including the 1758 edition of  Hannah Glasse 's  The Art of Cookery , attest. [11] 
 
 Dishes [ edit ] 
 Further information:  English cuisine § Indian and Anglo-Indian cuisine , and  List of chutneys 
 Well-known Anglo-Indian dishes include chutneys,  salted   beef tongue ,  kedgeree , [12]  ball curry, fish  rissoles , and  mulligatawny soup . [1] [7]   Chutney , one of the few Indian dishes that has had a lasting influence [1]  on  English cuisine , is a cooked and sweetened but not highly spiced preparation of fruit, nuts or vegetables. It borrows from a tradition of jam making where an equal amount of sour fruit and refined sugar reacts with the pectin in the fruit such as sour apples or rhubarb, the sour note being provided by vinegar.  Major Grey's Chutney  is typical. [13] 
 Pish pash was defined by  Hobson-Jobson  as "a slop of rice-soup with small pieces of meat in it, much used in the Anglo-Indian nursery". The term was first recorded by  Augustus Prinsep  in the mid 19th century. [14]  The name comes from the Persian  pash-pash , from  pashidan , to break. [15]  A version of the dish is given in  The Cookery Book of Lady Clark of Tillypronie  of 1909. [1] 
 
 Restaurants [ edit ] 
 Further information:  English cuisine § Indian and Anglo-Indian cuisine 
 Some early restaurants in England, such as the Hindoostane Coffee House on George Street,  London , which opened in 1810, served Anglo-Indian food.
Many Indian restaurants, however, have reverted to the standard mix-and-match Indian dishes that are better known to the British public.
