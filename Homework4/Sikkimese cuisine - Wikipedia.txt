   Food portal v t e In the  cuisine of  Sikkim , in  northeastern India ,  rice  is a staple food, and  fermented foods  traditionally constitute a significant portion of the cuisine. [1]   Indian cuisine  is popular, as Sikkim is the only state of India with an ethnic  Indian Gorkha  majority. Many restaurants in Sikkim serve various types of Nepalese cuisine, such as the  Limbu ,  Newa  and  Thakali  cuisines.  Tibetan  cuisine has also influenced Sikkimese cuisine. The combination of various cuisines has resulted in one specific cuisine.
 
 Agriculture [ edit ] 
   Chhurpi 
 The geography and modes of food production within Sikkim inform the food culture within the state. [2]  The economy of Sikkim is largely agrarian. [3]  Due to the state's mountainous terrain, much of the land is unsuitable for farming, so  terrace farming , particularly of rice, is common. In addition to rice, [4]  other  cereal crops  cultivated in Sikkim include  wheat ,  maize ,  barley , and  millet .  Potatoes ,  ginger ,  oranges ,  tea , and  cardamom  are also cultivated. [5] [6]  Sikkim produces the most cardamom  [7]  of any Indian state, about 4200 tons annually. [8]  Vegetables commonly grown include  tomatoes ,  broccoli , and  iskus . [9] 
 Although  dairy  and, to a lesser extent,  meat  and  egg  products are common elements of the Sikkimese diet, livestock primarily plays a subsidiary role in Sikkim's agricultural sector.  Cattle ,  sheep ,  goats ,  pigs  and  yaks  are raised. 11.7% of people in the rural areas of Sikkim are vegetarian. [10] 
 In 2016, Sikkim became India's first "organic state" after fully converting its agricultural land to  sustainable farming practices . [11] 
 
 Fermented foods and common dishes [ edit ] 
   Tomba is a Sikkimese drink made from fermented  millet : warm water is added to the millet and the liquid is consumed. 
 Fermented foods  are an integral part of Sikkimese cuisine, comprising 12.6% of total food consumption in the state. Polling indicates that 67.7% of Sikkimese people prepare fermented foods at home rather than purchasing them. This suggests that most fermentation is done at the household level with the notable exceptions of chhurpi and marchaa (a starter culture for fermentation), which are purchased in markets. [10] 
 Various fermented alcoholic beverages are produced by the introduction of marchaa to cereal grain and subsequent saccharification and fermentation in an airtight vessel. Millet, rice, and maize are commonly used. The grain is washed, cooked, combined with marchaa, then saccharified in an earthware pot for about 1–2 days, then fermented for 2–8 days. [12] 
Examples of traditional fermented foods are  kinema ,  gundruk ,  sinki ,  maseura , and khalpi. Traditional fermented beverages include  chyang ,  tongba ,  raksi , and kodo ko jaanr.
 
 Dishes [ edit ] 
 Sikkimese meals typically follow a bhat-dal-tharkari-achar (Rice-Pulses-Curry-Pickle) pattern. [10]
