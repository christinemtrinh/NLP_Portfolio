 British cuisine  is the specific set of cooking traditions and practices associated with the United Kingdom. Historically, British cuisine meant "unfussy dishes made with quality local ingredients, matched with simple sauces to accentuate flavour, rather than disguise it" [ according to whom? ] . International recognition of British cuisine was historically limited to the  full breakfast  and the  Christmas dinner . However,  Celtic agriculture  and animal breeding produced a wide variety of foodstuffs for indigenous  Celts . Wine and words such as beef and mutton were brought to Britain by the Normans [1]  while  Anglo-Saxon England  developed meat and savoury herb stewing techniques before the practice became common in Europe. The  Norman conquest  introduced exotic spices into  Great Britain in the Middle Ages .
 The  pub  is an important aspect of British culture and cuisine, and is often the focal point of local communities. Referred to as their "local" by regulars, pubs are typically chosen for their proximity to home or work, the availability of a particular  beer  or  ale  or a good selection, good food, a social atmosphere, the presence of friends and acquaintances, and the availability of  pub games  such as  darts  or  snooker . Pubs will often screen televised sports events. In recent years, some pubs have adapted to a culture in which fewer young people enjoy drinking alcohol or will not consume it in the same quantities as in the past. [2] 
 New foodstuffs have arrived over the millennia, from  sausages  in Roman times, and rice, sugar, oranges, and spices from Asia in the  Middle Ages , to New World beans and potatoes in the  Columbian exchange  after 1492, and spicy curry sauces from India in the 18th and 19th centuries. Many vegetables seen today in British cuisine such as cabbage, peas, and cherries, were also brought as crops by the Romans. [3] 
 More recently,  Indian cuisine  has brought wide variety of food to Britain and was not only consumed in its native form, but was adapted to suit British tastes, dishes such as  chicken tikka masala ,  balti dishes ,  kedgeree , mulligatawny soup and  coronation chicken  all took their inspiration from the food brought to Britain from  India .
 Traditional British dishes include  full breakfast ,  roast dinner ,  fish and chips , and  shepherd's pie . Traditional British desserts include  trifle ,  scones ,  apple pie  and  Victoria sponge cake . British cuisine has distinctive national varieties in the form of  English ,  Scottish ,  Welsh  and  Northern Irish cuisines . Modern British cuisine has also been strongly influenced by other cuisines from around the world, and has in turn strongly influenced the cuisines of many other cultures around the world.
 
 
 History [ edit ] 
 Beginnings [ edit ] 
 Bread  from mixed cereal grains was first made around 3700 BC in Britain. [4] 
 Cider  is an ancient British beverage. The first recorded reference to cider dates back to Julius Caesar’s first attempt to invade Britain in 55 BCE where he found the native Celts fermenting crabapples. He would take the discovery back through continental Europe with his retreating troops. [5] 
 In Roman times , further foods were introduced, such as  sausages , [6] [7]   rabbit , [8]  herbs and spices from further south in the Roman empire such as  chives [9]  and  coriander , [10]  and  wine , which was  produced in Britain  in vineyards as far north as  Northamptonshire  and  Lincolnshire . [11] 
 Prior to and after the Norman conquest of England in 1066, British food mostly consisted of vegetables, cereals and mutton. [12] 
 In the Middle Ages, the  Anglo-Saxons  introduced  bacon  to Britain sometime during the 1st millennium AD. [13]  The  Norman conquest  reintroduced spices and continental influences into  Great Britain in the Middle Ages ; [14]   oranges  arrived in the late 13th century, [15]   sugar cane  in the 14th, [16]  and  carrots  in the 15th century. [17] 
 
 Early Modern to 19th century [ edit ] 
 With the Western exploration of the New World in 1492, the  Columbian exchange  led to the arrival in Europe of many new foods, including refined  sugar , the  potato , the  banana [18]  and  chocolate . The growth in worldwide trade brought foods and beverages from the Old World too, including  tea [19]  and  coffee . [20]  Developments in plant breeding greatly increased the number of fruit and vegetable varieties.
 The  turkey  was introduced to Britain in the 16th century, [21]  but its use for  Christmas dinner , with  Christmas pudding  for dessert, was a 19th-century innovation. [22] [23]  Other   traditional British dishes, like  fish and chips  and the  full breakfast , rose to prominence in the Victorian era; [24] [25]  while they have a status in British culture, they are not necessarily a large part of many people's diets. [26] 
 
 20th century [ edit ] 
 Further information:  English cuisine § Twentieth century 
   Shepherds's pie, a traditional British dish 
 During the World Wars of the 20th century difficulties of food supply were countered by measures such as  rationing . Rationing continued for nearly ten years after the Second World War, and in some aspects was stricter than during wartime, so that a whole generation was raised without access to many previously common ingredients, possibly contributing to a decline of British cuisine. [27]  Writing in the 1960s about British cuisine in the 1950s, the  Good Food Guide  called the food of the 1950s "intolerable" due to a shortage of real ingredients such as butter, cream or meat. [28]  A hunger for cooking from abroad was satisfied by writers such as  Elizabeth David , who from 1950 produced evocative books, starting with  A Book of Mediterranean Food , whose ingredients were then often impossible to find in Britain. [29] 
 By the 1960s foreign holidays, and foreign-style restaurants in Britain, widened the popularity of foreign cuisine. This movement was assisted by  celebrity chefs  – on television and in their books – such as  Fanny Cradock ,  Clement Freud ,  Robert Carrier ,  Keith Floyd ,  Gary Rhodes ,  Delia Smith ,  Gordon Ramsay ,   Ainsley Harriott ,  Nigella Lawson ,  Simon Hopkinson ,  Nigel Slater  and  Jamie Oliver . [29] [30] 
 From the 1970s, the availability and range of good quality fresh products increased, and the British population became more willing to vary its diet. Modern British cooking draws on influences from  Mediterranean , and more recently,  Middle Eastern  and Asian cuisines. [ citation needed ]  In the 1990s and early 2000s, a form of "virtuous eclecticism" emerged in discourse around British cuisine, arguing that British cuisine can be distinguished by its apparently unique ability to draw from other cultures. [28] 
 Furthermore, from the 1970s there was an increased push to recognise a distinctly British cuisine. The  English Tourist Board  campaigned for restaurants to include more British historical and regional dishes on their menus. In the 1980s, in the face of globalisation - which made foreign cuisines and imported produce more widely available in the UK - a style of cooking known as Modern British Cooking emerged in an effort to construct a national cuisine for the tourist industry. This new style of cooking focused on the garden and vegetables. [28] 
 
 Anglo-Indian cuisine [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Anglo-Indian cuisine 
   Kedgeree , an  Anglo-Indian dish 
 In the 18th and 19th centuries, the Colonial  British Empire  began to be influenced by  India's elaborate food tradition  with strong spices and herbs. Traditional British cuisine was modified with the addition of  Indian-style  spices and ingredients such as  rice , creating dishes such as  kedgeree  (1790) [31]  and  mulligatawny soup  (1791). [32] [33] 
 Curry became popular in Britain by the 1970s, when some restaurants that originally catered mainly to Indians found their clientele diversifying. [34]   Chicken tikka masala , a mildly spiced dish in a creamy sauce, invented around 1971 in Britain, has been called "a true British national dish." [35] [36] 
 
 21st century [ edit ] 
 British culinary preferences have continued to evolve in the 21st century. Many people in a 2021 survey had never eaten such traditional favourites as  toad in the hole ,  spotted dick ,  Scotch eggs ,  black pudding , or  bubble and squeak , and a minority did not believe these dishes existed. [37] 
 In September 2022, Debora Robertson wrote in the  Daily Telegraph  that the 21st century has seen 'a revolution in British dining, fine and otherwise'. [38] 
 
 Characteristics [ edit ] 
 According to Warde, three definitions of British cuisine in response to globalisation predominate. Modern British Cooking draws on Britain's culinary history to create a new British traditional cuisine. Virtuous eclecticism highlights the melting pot of different national cuisines present in the UK. Another draws on popular, common products to produce a form of historical continuity between historical and modern cuisines. [28] 
 Internationally, British food tends to have a perception of being "terrible": bland, soggy, overcooked and visually unappealing. [39]  The reason for this is debated. One popular reason is that British culinary traditions were strong before the mid-20th century, when British cuisine suffered due to wartime rationing. [39]  A lot of myths about British food originate from this period. [40]  An alternative hypothesis is that British people are "too repressed" to cook properly and that British culture is not adept to serving lavish meals. [39] 
 
 Popular dishes [ edit ] 
 According to a survey by YouGov, the most popular British food is the  Yorkshire pudding , which over 85% of Brits say they like, closely followed by Sunday roasts and fish and chips. The least popular was jellied eels, which only 6% of those who had tried it liked. Scones and  Victoria sponge  are the most popular sweet foods, while the  Deep-fried Mars bar  is the least popular. [41] 
 Curries are a large part of British cuisine, with cooks in the United Kingdom creating curries distinct to the country.  Chicken tikka masala , which comprises 15 percent of orders in British Indian restaurants, was called "a true British national dish" by the Foreign Secretary Robin Cook in 2001. [42]  Generally,  British curries  are thicker and sweeter than their Indian counterparts. Furthermore, curry sauces in Britain are interchangeable between meats, while in India different meats have non-interchangeable sauces. [43]  A key ingredient to a British curry is  curry powder , a "British concoction" of spices. [44] 
 
 National cuisines [ edit ] 
 English [ edit ] 
 Main article:  English cuisine 
 English cuisine  has distinctive attributes of its own, but also shares much with wider British cuisine, partly through the importation of ingredients and ideas from  North America ,  China , and  India  during the time of the  British Empire  and as a result of  post-war   immigration . Some traditional meals, such as  sausages , bread and  cheese , roasted and stewed meats,  meat  and  game pies , boiled vegetables and broths, and  freshwater  and  saltwater fish  have ancient origins. The 14th-century English cookbook, the  Forme of Cury , contains recipes for these, and dates from the royal court of  Richard II . [45] 
 
 Northern Irish [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Northern Irish cuisine 
 Northern Ireland's culinary heritage has its roots in the staple diet of generations of farming families—bread and potatoes. [46]   Historically, limited availability of ingredients and low levels of immigration resulted in restricted variety and relative isolation from wider international culinary influences. The 21st century has seen significant improvements in local cuisine, characterised by an increase in the variety, quantity and quality of  gastropubs  and  restaurants . There are currently three  Michelin star  restaurants in Northern Ireland, both of which specialise in traditional dishes made using local ingredients. [47] 
 
 Scottish [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Scottish cuisine 
 Scottish cuisine has closer links to Scandinavia and France than English cuisine has. [48]  Traditional Scottish dishes include  bannock ,  brose ,  cullen skink ,  Dundee cake ,  haggis ,  marmalade ,  porridge , and  Scotch broth . [48] [49]  The cuisines of the northern islands of  Orkney  and  Shetland  are distinctively different from that of mainland Scotland. [48]  The nation is known for  its whiskies .
 
 Welsh [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Welsh cuisine 
 Welsh cuisine in the Middle Ages was limited in range;  Gerald of Wales , chaplain to  Henry II , wrote after an 1188 tour that "The whole population lives almost entirely on oats and the produce of their herds, milk, cheese and butter. You must not expect a variety of dishes from a Welsh kitchen, and there are no highly-seasoned titbits to whet your appetite." [50] 
The cuisine includes recipes for Welsh  lamb , and dishes such as  cawl ,  Welsh rarebit ,  laverbread ,  Welsh cakes ,  bara brith  and  Glamorgan sausage . [50]

 International cuisines [ edit ] 
 The UK has had availability of a large variety of foreign cuisines since the post-war period. In 1970, the  Good Food Guide  stated: "London now has a richer variety of restaurants than any other city on Earth". [28]  In 1995, the  Good Food Guide  argued that the fusion of national cuisines "could only happen here", as Britain is a  melting pot  without as distinct of a national cuisine as other such countries. [28]
