 Local cuisine of the Basque region 
 The traditional  pintxos 
 Basque cuisine  refers to the cuisine of the  Basque Country  and includes meats and fish grilled over hot coals,  marmitako  and  lamb stews ,  cod ,  Tolosa  bean dishes,  paprikas  from  Lekeitio ,  pintxos  (Basque  tapas ) ,  Idiazabal sheep's cheese ,  txakoli  ( sparkling   white wine ), and  Basque cider .
 A  basquaise  is a type of dish prepared in the style of Basque cuisine that often includes  tomatoes  and sweet or hot red  peppers .
 
 
 Overview [ edit ] 
 Basques have also been quick to absorb new ingredients and techniques from new settlers and from their own trade and exploration links.  Jews  expelled from Spain and  Portugal  created a chocolate and confectionery industry in  Bayonne  still well-known today, and part of a wider confectionery and pastry tradition across the Basque Country. Basques embraced the  potato  and the  capsicum , used in hams, sausages and recipes, with pepper festivals around the area, notably  Ezpeleta  and  Puente la Reina .
 Olive oil  is more commonly used than  vegetable oil  in Basque cooking. [1] 
 Cuisine and the kitchen are at the heart of Basque culture, and there is a Museum of Gastronomy in  Llodio .
 One of the staple cookbooks for traditional Basque dishes was initially published in 1933. "La cocina de Nicolasa" (the Kitchen of Nicolasa) by  Nicolasa Pradera  has gone into 20 editions. [2] 
 
 Ways of eating [ edit ] 
   A dish of  marmitako  in  bonito  variety 
 In addition to the dishes and products of the Basque Country, there are features of the way of preparing and sharing food unique to the area.
 Cider houses ( sagardotegiak ) are a feature of the hills around  Donostia , especially near  Astigarraga . These are usually large country restaurants with enormous barrels of cider. Cider is poured from a height straight into the glass for visitors, with a rustic menu invariably of salt cod  omelette , grilled  T-bone steak  and ewes' milk cheese with  walnuts  and  quince  paste. The cider houses are only open for a few months of the year.
 The  txikiteo  is the tapas crawl from bar to bar seen across Spain, but it reaches its pinnacle in  Donostia , with hundreds of people on the streets of the old town wandering from bar to bar, each known for its specialty, whether it be  croquettes ,  tortilla , toast, or seafood. The txikiteo is also popular in cities such as  Pamplona  and  Bilbao .
 Gerezi beltza arno gorriakin [3]  is a cherry soup served warm or cold. The cherries are  poached  in  wine , often with enough  sugar  added to make a light  syrup . A cherry without pits is preferred for this dish. To release their flavor, the cherries are carefully  pitted  or cut in half. Usually the soup is prepared on the day it will be served, because 24 hours is enough time for the cherries to blanch noticeably in the liquid. The soup is often served with a dollop of  sour cream ,  crème fraîche , or  ice cream .
 Gastronomic societies are organisations, almost always of men, who cook and eat together in a communal  txoko .

 New Basque Cuisine [ edit ] 
 In the 1970s and 1980s Basque chefs were influenced by the  nouvelle cuisine  of France and created the  nouvelle cuisine basque , radically original in its form but solidly Basque in substance, with lighter and less rustic versions of traditional dishes and flavours. The first Spanish restaurant to be awarded 3 stars in the Michelin Guide was, in fact,  Zalacaín , a Basque restaurant, although located in Madrid.  Juan Mari Arzak  in Donostia became the most famous exponent and one of the first three-star  Michelin Guide  restaurants in Spain.
In a few years the movement swept across Spain, becoming the state's default  haute cuisine . Many tapas bars, especially in San Sebastián, serve modern-style  pintxos  employing novel techniques and ingredients. In more recent years, young chefs, such as  Martin Berasategui , have given new impetus to Basque cuisine.
 
 International Basque cuisine [ edit ] 
 Basque cuisine has continued to have an influence on international cuisine, particularly in Spain and France where it is highly regarded.  Catalan  chef  Ferran Adrià  has taken the techniques pioneered by Arzak and other Basque chefs to new heights.  Karlos Arguiñano  has popularised Basque cuisine in Spain through TV and books. Teresa Barrenechea was among the first people to bring traditional Basque cuisine to America with her first restaurant Marichu in Bronxville in 1991, where she hired Chef Joseba Encabo to set up, develop the menus and run the restaurant till soon later he was offered a position as faculty at the  Culinary Institute of America  in  Hyde Park, New York . Teresa Barrenechea and husband Raynold von Samson continued to promote Basque cuisine in America by opening their second Marichu restaurant in Manhattan in 1994, which was close to the United Nations Headquarters. Teresa Barrenechea has written two books,  The Basque Table  (Harvard Common Press, Boston 1998) and  The Cuisines of Spain  (Ten Speed, Berkley 2005). Teresa Barrenechea is the holder of two awards: Premio Nacional de Gastronomía [4]  (National Prize of Gastronomy, the highest culinary award given by the Spanish Administration) and Best Regional Cuisine Book at the 5th World Cookbook Fair, [5]   Périgueux  (France).  At the other end of the scale, Basque-style  pintxos  bars are common in  Barcelona  and  Madrid . In cities where large numbers of Basque people emigrated, such as  Buenos Aires ,  Argentina ;  São Paulo ,  Brazil ,  Boise ,  Idaho ;  Fresno ,  California , and  Bakersfield ,  California , there are several Basque restaurants and a noted Basque influence on the local cuisine.
