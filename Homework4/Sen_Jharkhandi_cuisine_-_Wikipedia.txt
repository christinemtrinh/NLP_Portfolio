Jharkhandi cuisine encompasses the cuisine of the Indian state of Jharkhand.
Staple foods of Jharkhand are rice, dal and vegetables.
[1] Common meals often consist of vegetables that are cooked in various ways, such as curried, fried, roasted and boiled.
[2] Many traditional dishes of  Jharkhand may not be available at restaurants.
[3] However, on a visit to a local village, one can get a chance to experience such exotic foods.
Some dish preparations may be mild with low oil and spice content, although pickles and festive dishes may have such characteristics.
The twenty-four districts of Jharkhand receive supplemental food security supplies as per the National Food Security Act, 2013 of India.
[19] In the past, food supplies were distributed to the districts in phases, which some have criticized as problematic.
[19] In June 2015, Ram Vilas Paswan, the Minister of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution for the government of India stated a preference toward the Food Security Act to be implemented all at once, rather than in phases.
[19] In this manner, Paswan stated a preference for distributions to be completed in entirety by September 1, 2015.
