 Traditional  Estonian cuisine  has substantially been based on  meat  and  potatoes , and on  fish  in coastal and lakeside areas, but now bears influence from many other cuisines, including a variety of international foods and dishes, with a number of contributions from the traditions of nearby countries.  Scandinavian ,  German ,  Russian ,  Latvian ,  Lithuanian  and other influences have played their part. The most typical foods in Estonia have been  rye bread ,  pork , potatoes and  dairy products . [1]  Estonian eating habits have historically been closely linked to the seasons. In terms of staples, Estonia belongs firmly to the  beer ,  vodka , rye bread and pork "belt" of Europe.
 
 
 Cold table [ edit ] 
   Flounder 
 The first course in traditional Estonian cuisine is based on cold dishes—a selection of pickles, meats and  sausages  served with  potato salad  ( kartulisalat ) or  rosolje , an Estonian signature dish almost identical to Swedish  sillsallad , based on  beetroot , potatoes and  herring . [2]  Small pastries called  pirukad  ( pirukas  in the singular)—a relative of the  pirozhki —filled with meat,  cabbage ,  carrots ,  rice  and other fillings or mixtures are also popular, and are often served with  bouillion . Herring is common among other fish as a part of the Estonian cold table. Smoked or marinated  eel ,  crayfish  dishes, and imported  crabs  and  shrimp  are considered delicacies. One of Estonia's national dishes is  räim  (Baltic dwarf  herring ), along with  sprats .  Flounder ,  perch  and  pike-perch  are also popular. [ citation needed ] 
 
   Kiluvõileib 
 In the 20th century, a special sandwich called  kiluvõileib  has become popular. This sandwich consists of a traditional rye bread open sandwich with thin layer of butter and a layer of  vürtsikilu  (pickled Baltic sprats) as topping. Boiled egg slices, mayonnaise and culinary herbs are optional extra toppings. [ citation needed ] 
 
 Soups [ edit ] 
 Soups  may be eaten before the main course, but traditionally form the main meal and most often are made of meat or  chicken stock  mixed with a variety of vegetables. Soups are also blended with  sour cream ,  milk  and  yogurt .  Pea soup  is also quite popular. [2]  
A unique form of Estonian soup is  leivasupp  ("bread soup"), which is a type of sweet soup that is made of black bread and apples, normally served with sour cream or whipped cream, often seasoned with cinnamon and sugar. [ citation needed ] 
 
 Main course [ edit ] 
   Black rye bread (rukkileib) is also eaten as a pub snack. 
 Black  rye bread  ( rukkileib ) accompanies almost every savory food in Estonia. Estonians continue to value their varieties of black rye-based bread. [ citation needed ] 
 
 Desserts [ edit ] 
   Estonian red  currant  kissell 
 Specific desserts include  kissell ,  kohuke  (curd snack) and  kama . Other common Estonian desserts are  mannavaht  (a cream made of  semolina  and juice or fruit),  kohupiimakreem  (creamy curd),  kompott  ( compote ) and  martsipan  ( marzipan ). Rhubarb pies are also a favorite. Another popular dessert is  kringel  ( kringle ), a sweet yeast bread often flavored with  cardamom . [ citation needed ]   Pancakes  ( pannkook , plural  pannkoogid ) are also traditional, common, and popular. They are fried and are usually with sweet fillings but they can be savoury too.
 
 Drinks [ edit ] 
   Local wines are mainly  fruit wines . 
 The traditionally popular drink  kali , similar to  kvass , has become more popular again.  Mead  ( mõdu ), the drink that was most popular in ancient times, has almost completely disappeared.  Birch sap  ( kasemahl ) beverages are also quite popular. Nowadays, locally brewed beer is the number one choice to accompany food; different juices or simply water being the main non-alcoholic choice. Two of Estonia's oldest breweries are  A. Le Coq , founded in 1807, and  Saku Brewery , founded in 1820.  Wine  is widely drunk, and although it is still not as popular as beer, it is becoming all the more common. There are also Estonian fruit wines made of  apples  or different  berries . Estonians are also proud of their  vodka  and other  spirits , such as the herbal liqueur  Vana Tallinn . 
 Milk  ( piim ) is also widely drunk by children as well as adults. Other dairy products besides milk include  keefir  and also  hapupiim  ("sour milk") and  pett , which are variations on the theme of  buttermilk . Dairy from  Andre, Estonia  is well known as part of Estonian dairy-related cuisine. [3] 
 
 Seasons [ edit ] 
 Summer and spring [ edit ] 
 Traditionally in summer and spring, Estonians like to eat everything fresh—berries, herbs, vegetables and everything else that comes straight from the garden. Hunting and fishing were common in history. Nowadays, they have remained as popular pastimes. It is popular to  barbecue  in the summer. [ citation needed ] 
 
 Winter and Christmas [ edit ] 
 During the winter months,  jam , preserves and  pickles  are brought to the table. During the past, when the economy was largely agricultural, the gathering and conserving of fruits,  mushrooms  and vegetables for winter was essential. Today, gathering and conserving is less common because almost everything can be bought from stores, but preparing food for winter is still very popular in the countryside and continues to retain its charm for many, as opposed to the commercialization of eating habits. [ citation needed ] 
 Blood sausage  ( verivorst ),  roast goose  ( jõuluhani ),  sepik  bread,  head cheese  ( sült ), and  sauerkraut  ( hapukapsas ) with oven-roasted  potatoes  have been part of the traditional Estonian menu that nowadays are mostly Christmas specialties. Also, typical Christmas treats have been  apples ,  mandarin oranges ,  gingerbread  and  lingonberry jam . [ citation needed ]
