Gabonese cuisine is the cooking traditions, practices, foods and dishes associated with Gabon, a sovereign state on the west coast of Central Africa. French cuisine is prevalent as a notable influence,[1] and in larger cities various French specialties are available.[2] In rural areas, food staples such as cassava, rice and yams are commonly used.[2][3]
 Meats, when available, include chicken and fish, and bush meats such as antelope, wild boar and monkey.[2] Sauces are often used, with hot red-pepper berbere paste being a common example.[2]
 Fruits include bananas, papayas, guavas, mangoes, pineapples, coconuts, avocado and peanuts.[4] Plantains, tomatoes, corn, and eggplant are also used.[4]
