 Kerala cuisine  is a culinary style originated in the  Kerala , a  state  on the southwestern  Malabar Coast  of  India . Kerala cuisine offers a multitude of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes prepared using  fish ,  poultry  and  red meat  with rice as a typical accompaniment.  Chillies ,  curry leaves ,  coconut ,  mustard seeds ,  turmeric ,  tamarind ,  asafoetida  and other  spices  are also used in the preparation.

 Kerala is known as the "Land of Spices" because it traded spices with Europe as well as with many ancient civilizations with the oldest historical records of the Sumerians from 3000 BCE. [1] [2] 
 
 
 Historical and cultural influences [ edit ] 
 In addition to historical diversity, cultural influences, particularly the large  introduction of  Muslims  and  Christians , have also added unique dishes and styles to  Kerala  cuisine, especially non-vegetarian dishes.  
 Most modern-day Hindus do not observe religious dietary restrictions, except a few belonging to specific castes that do not consume  beef  or  pork . [3]  Most Muslims do not eat pork and other food  forbidden by Islamic law .  Alcohol  is available in Kerala in many hotels and over a thousand bars and liquor stores.
 
 Overview [ edit ] 
   A restaurant menu in Kerala 
   Traditional Kerala  sadhya 
   Idiyappam  served with egg 
 One of the traditional Kerala dishes is vegetarian and is called the Kerala  sadya . A full-course  sadya , consists of rice with about 20 different accompaniments and desserts, and is the ceremonial meal of Kerala eaten usually on celebratory occasions including weddings,  Onam  and  Vishu . It is served on a  plantain  leaf.
 Because of its rich trading heritage, over time, various indigenous Kerala dishes have been blended with foreign dishes to adapt them to local tastes.  Coconuts  grow in abundance in Kerala, so grated coconut and coconut milk are commonly used for thickening and flavouring. [4] 
 Kerala's long coastline and numerous rivers have led to a strong fishing industry in the region, making seafood a common part of meals. Rice is grown in abundance along with  tapioca . It is the main starch ingredient used in Kerala's food. [5] 
 Having been a major production area of spices for thousands of years, the region makes frequent use of black pepper, cardamom, clove, ginger, and cinnamon. Kerala also has a variety of breakfast dishes like  idli ,   dosa ,   appam ,   idiyappam ,   puttu ,  and  pathiri . [6] 
 
 Hindu cuisine [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Sadya 
 A typical  sadhya , where  banana leaves  are used as plates Sadhya  items ready to be served. Clockwise from top:  paayasam  or  pradhaman , bitter gourd  thoran ,  aviyal ,  kaalan , lime pickle,  sambar , and buttermilk with boiled rice in center 
 The vast majority of Kerala's Hindus, except certain communities and  ovo-lacto vegetarians , eat fish, red meat (beef, carabeef, and pork) and chicken. There are many vegetarians in Kerala, also throughout India. [7] 
 
 Mappila cuisine [ edit ] 
 See also:  Thalassery cuisine 
 Pathiri , a pancake made of  rice flour , is one of the common breakfast dishes among  Mappilas Kallummakkaya nirachathu  or  arikkadukka  (mussels stuffed with rice) Thalassery  biryani  with  raita Halwas are popular everywhere in kerala 
 Muslim cuisine  or  Mappila  cuisine is a blend of traditional  Kerala ,  Persian ,  Arab ,  Portuguese  and  Western  food culture. [8]  This confluence of culinary cultures is best seen in the preparation of most dishes. [8]   Kallummakkaya  ( mussels )  curry ,  irachi puttu  ( irachi  meaning meat),  Pathiri  (a type of rice pancake), [8]  and  ghee  rice are some of the other specialties. The characteristic use of spices is the hallmark of Mappila cuisine— black pepper ,  cardamom , and  clove  are used profusely. 
 Kuzhi Mandi  ( Mandi (food) ) is another popular item, which has an influence from  Yemen . Malabar biriyani is known as Thalassery biriyani which uses kaima rice for preparation and is called as dum biriyani. Malabar biriyani originated from  Thalassery  and spread to other places.  [9]   [10] 
 The snacks include  unnakkaya  (deep-fried, boiled ripe  banana  paste covering a mixture of cashew,  raisins  and  sugar ), [11]   pazham nirachathu  (ripe banana filled with  coconut  grating,  molasses  or sugar), [11]   muttamala  made of  eggs , [8]   chatti pathiri , a  dessert  made of flour, like a baked, layered  chapati  with rich filling,  arikkadukka , [12]  and more. [8] 
 
 Nasrani cuisine [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Theenmura 
 Kozhukkatta  is prepared by  Saint Thomas Christians  on the Saturday prior to  Palm Sunday  and the day is hence called Kozhukatta Saturday. Pidiyum Kozhiyum Meen molee Beef ularthiathu 
 Christians of Kerala—especially Mar Thoma Nasranis ( St Thomas Christians )—have their own cuisine which is a blend of  Indian ,  Middle Eastern ,  Syrian ,  Jewish  and  Western  styles and flavours of cooking.
 A favourite dish of Kerala Christians is  mappas , or  ishtu . [13]  For this dish, chicken/ beef, potatoes, carrots, green peas and onions are simmered gently in coconut milk flavoured with black pepper, cinnamon, coriander, mint, cloves, green chillies, lime juice, and shallots . In Central Kerala, this is made only with beef or lamb, the usage of chicken in stew is very rare. [14]  Lamb and duck can replace chicken in the stew recipe.
 Pidi  is another dish made mainly by Syrian Christians from Central Kerala ( Ernakulam  and  Thrissur ), consisting of dumplings made from rice flour boiled in a mixture of coconut milk, cumin seeds and garlic. [14] 
 Other dishes include  piralen  (chicken stir-fried),  meat thoran/ roast/ullathiyathu  (dry curry with shredded coconut), seafood and duck roast, and  meen molee  (spicy stewed fish). [14]  This is eaten with  appam . [14]  Pork vindaloo and  Meen mulakittathu or meen vatichathu  (fish in fiery red chilli sauce) is another favourite item. [14] 
 Latin Christian  ceremonial food includes bread and stew are served after cake and wine at the banquet, followed by a meal with fish, cutlets, salads, pork, vindaloo, fish moli, duck roast and mustad (mustard and coriander skins fried in vinegar) are important in their diet. [14] 
 Irachi ularthiathu , also known as  Kerala beef fry  is a beef dish cooked with spices. [14]
