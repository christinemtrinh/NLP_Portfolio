 Macanese cuisine  ( Chinese :  澳門土生葡菜 ,  Portuguese :  culinária macaense ) is mainly influenced by  Chinese cuisine , especially  Cantonese cuisine  and  European cuisine , especially  Portuguese cuisine  and influences from  Southeast Asia  and the Lusophone world, due to Macau's past as a Portuguese colony and long history of being an international tourist gambling centre.
 Minchi ,  egg tarts , pork chop buns, ginger milk and almond cakes are some of the region's most common delicacies. Common cooking methods make use of various spices such as  turmeric ,  coconut milk , and  cinnamon  to give dishes an extra kick of aroma and enhancement of taste. Many routinely consumed dishes in Macau belong to a subclass ( Heungshan ) of Cantonese cuisine. Many Macanese dishes resulted from the spice blends that the wives of Portuguese sailors used in an attempt to replicate European dishes with local Chinese ingredients and seasonings.
 Typically, Macanese food is seasoned with various spices including  turmeric ,  coconut milk , and  cinnamon , and dried cod ( bacalhau ), giving special aromas and tastes. Popular dishes include  galinha à Portuguesa ,  galinha à Africana  (African chicken),  bacalhau  (traditional Portuguese salt cod),  pato de cabidela , Macanese chili shrimps,  minchi , [1] [2] [3]  stir-fried curry crab; pig's ear and papaya salad, and rabbit stewed in wine, cinnamon and star anise.
 Cha Gordo  (literally "Fat Tea" [4] ) is a culinary tradition amongst the  Macanese  community in  Macau  that is likened to  afternoon tea . [4]  Historically, families with Portuguese heritage in Macau would host a  Cha Gordo  for a number of occasions, including  Catholic  holidays,  christening , or birthdays, but they can be held for any reason. [5]  Historically, some families would even host one on a weekly basis. [4]  A  Cha Gordo  would take place following a Macanese  wedding , instead of the elaborate  banquet  seen in Chinese weddings. [6]
