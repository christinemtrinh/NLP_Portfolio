   The  KaDeWe  in Berlin, one of the largest delicatessen markets in Europe 
 The  cuisine of Germany  ( German :  Deutsche Küche ) consists of many different local or regional cuisines, reflecting the country's federal history.  Germany  itself is part of the larger cultural region of  Central Europe , sharing many culinary traditions with neighbouring countries such as  Poland  and the  Czech Republic  (and  Slovakia  as well). In  Northern Europe , in  Denmark  more specifically, the traditional  Danish cuisine  had also been influenced by German cuisine in the past, hence several dishes being common between the two countries (e.g.  potato salad ).
 At the same time, the German cuisine also shares many similar characteristics with the Western European cuisine, as is reflected by some common traditional dishes served in the  Low Countries  (i.e.  Netherlands ,  Belgium , and, most notably,  Luxembourg ). Southern German regions, such as  Bavaria  and  Swabia , share dishes with  Austrian cuisine  and parts of  Swiss cuisine  as well. [1]  The German cuisine has also influenced other European cuisines from Central- Eastern Europe  such as those of  Hungary  or  Romania , both countries sharing past and current German heritage in general, through their ethnic German minorities (see also, for example in this regard, the  Transylvanian Saxon cuisine ).
 Furthermore, the  Michelin Guide  of 2015 awarded a  three-star ranking  (the highest designation) to 11 restaurants in Germany, while 38 more received two-star rankings and 233 one-star rankings. [2]  As of November 2017 [update] , Germany had the fourth-highest number of Michelin three-star restaurants in the world, after  Japan ,  France , and the  United States . [3] 
 
 
 Hot foods [ edit ] 
 Meat [ edit ] 
   The German döner kebap 
 The average annual meat consumption is 59.7 kg (132 lb) per person. The most common varieties are pork, poultry, and beef. Other varieties of meat are widely available, but are considered to be insignificant.
 
 Source: Statista.com, 2017 [4] 
 Meat is usually  braised ; fried dishes also exist, but these recipes usually originate from  France  and  Austria . Several cooking methods used to soften tough cuts have evolved into national specialties, including  Sauerbraten  (sour roast), involving marinating beef, horse meat or venison in a vinegar or wine vinegar mixture over several days.
 
   Plate of  Currywurst 
 A long tradition of sausage-making exists in Germany; more than 1,500 different types of sausage ( German :  Wurst ) are made. [5] [6] [7] [8]  Most  Wurst  is made with natural  casings  of pork, sheep or lamb intestines. Among the most popular and most common are  Bratwurst , usually made of ground pork and spices, the  Wiener  (Viennese), which may be pork or beef and is smoked and fully cooked in a water bath, and  Blutwurst  ( blood sausage ) or  Schwarzwurst  (black sausage) made from blood (often of pigs or geese). Thousands of types of cold cuts also are available which are also called "Wurst" in German. There are many regional specialties, such as the  Münchner Weißwurst  (Munich white sausage) popular in  Bavaria  or the  Currywurst  (depending on region, either a steamed pork sausage or a version of the  Bratwurst , sliced and spiced with curry ketchup) popular in the metropolitan areas of  Berlin ,  Hamburg  and the  Ruhr Area . Strict regulations governing what may and may not be put into them have been in force in Germany since the 13th century. In the market ordinance of Landshut in 1236, it was set down that only top-quality meat could be made into sausages.  Döner kebab  sales reach more than 3.5 billion euros each year, making it one of the most popular fast food items in the country. [9] [10] 
 
 Fish [ edit ] 
   Smoked  sprat 
 Of saltwater fish,  Alaska pollock  is the most common. [11]  Popular freshwater fish on the German menu are  trout ,  pike ,  carp , and  European perch  also are listed frequently. [12]  Seafood traditionally was restricted to the northern coastal areas, except for  pickled herring , which was often served in a  Fischbrötchen , as  Rollmops  (a pickled herring  fillet  rolled into a cylindrical shape around a piece of pickled gherkin or onion), or  Brathering  (fried,  marinated   herring ).
 Today, many sea fish, such as fresh herring,  tuna ,  mackerel ,  salmon  and  sardines , are well established throughout the country. [13] [14]  Prior to the industrial revolution and the ensuing pollution of the rivers, salmon were common in the rivers  Rhine ,  Elbe , and  Oder  and only slowly started to return along with a growing consciousness for environmental questions and resulting measures, such as state-of-the-art sewage plant and reduction of agricultural deposits.
 Fish fingers , known as Fischstäbchen (lit.: "fish sticklets"), [15]  are a popular  processed food  made using  whitefish  such as  cod ,  haddock  or  pollock , which has been  battered  or  breaded .
 
 Vegetables [ edit ] 
   Typical serving of asparagus with  Hollandaise sauce  and potatoes 
 Vegetables are often used in  stews  or vegetable soups, but are also served as  side dishes . Carrots, [16]  cauliflower, [17] [18]  turnips, [19]  spinach, [20]  peas, [21]  beans, broccoli and many types of cabbage are very common. [18] [22]  Fried onions are a common addition to many meat dishes throughout the country. Circa 1900, carrots were sometimes roasted in water, with the broth used in place of coffee. [23] 
 Asparagus  is a popular seasonal side or main dish with a yearly per-capita consumption of 1.5 kg (3.3 lb). [24]  The white variety is especially popular in Germany and more common than green asparagus. [25] [26]  Restaurants will sometimes devote an entire menu to nothing but white asparagus when it is in season. [27]  Spargel season ( German :  Spargelzeit  or  Spargelsaison ) traditionally begins in mid-April and ends on St. John's Day (24 June). [28] [29] 
 
 Structure of meals [ edit ] 
   German breakfast buffet in a hotel 
 Breakfast  ( Frühstück ) commonly consists of bread, toast, or bread rolls with butter or margarine,  cold cuts , cheeses, jam ( Konfitüre  or more commonly called  Marmelade ), honey and eggs (typically boiled). [30] [31] [32]  Common drinks at breakfast are coffee, tea, milk, cocoa (hot or cold) or fruit juices. [30]  It is very common to eat hearty toppings at breakfast, including deli meats like ham, salted meats, salami and meat-based spreads such as  Leberwurst  (liver sausage), Teewurst  or  Mettwurst  and cheeses such as Gouda,  Frischkäse  (cream cheese), Brie,  Harzer Roller ,  Bergkäse  and more. Most bakeries tend to sell  belegte Brötchen  (sandwiches from bread rolls), especially in the morning, for people on the go.
 Traditionally, the main meal of the day has been  lunch  ( Mittagessen ), eaten around noon. [33]   Dinner  ( Abendessen  or  Abendbrot ) was always a smaller meal, often consisting only of a variety of breads, meat or sausages, cheese and some kind of vegetables, similar to breakfast, or possibly sandwiches. Smaller meals added during the day bear names such as  Vesper  (in the south),  Brotzeit  (bread time, also in the south),  Kaffee und Kuchen  ( listen   ( help · info ) , literally for "coffee and cake"), or  Kaffeetrinken . It is a very German custom and comparable with the English  five-o'clock tea . It takes time between lunch and dinner, often on Sundays with the entire family.
 However, in Germany, as in other parts of Europe, dining habits have changed over the last 50 years. Today, many people eat only a small meal in the middle of the day at work, often also a second breakfast, and enjoy a hot dinner in the evening at home with the whole family. [34] 
 For others, the traditional way of eating is still rather common, not only in rural areas. Breakfast is still very popular and may be elaborate and extended on weekends, with friends invited as guests; the same holds for coffee and cake. Since the 1990s, the Sunday  brunch  has also become common, especially in city cafés.
 
 Side dishes [ edit ] 
   German fries  ( German :  Bratkartoffeln ) 
 Noodles , made from wheat flour and egg, are usually thicker than the  Italian  flat pasta. Especially in the southwestern part of the country, the predominant variety of noodles are  Spätzle , [35]  made with a large number of eggs, and  Maultaschen , traditional stuffed noodles reminiscent of  ravioli .
 Besides noodles, potatoes are common. [36]  Potatoes entered the German cuisine in the late 17th century, and were almost ubiquitous in the 19th century and since.  They most often are boiled (in salt water,  Salzkartoffeln ), but  mashed  ( Kartoffelpüree  or  Kartoffelbrei ) and pan-roasted  potatoes  ( Bratkartoffeln ) also are traditional.  French fries , called  Pommes frites ,  Pommes  (spoken as "Pom fritz" or, respectively, "Pommès", deviating from the French pronunciation which would be "Pom freet" or "Pom") or regionally as  Fritten  in German, are a common style of fried potatoes; they are traditionally offered with either  ketchup  or  mayonnaise , or, as  Pommes rot/weiß  (lit. fries red/white), with both.
 Also common are  dumplings [35] [37]  (including  Klöße  as the term in the north or  Knödel  as the term in the south) and in southern Germany potato noodles, including  Schupfnudeln , which are similar to Italian  gnocchi .
 Salads , also modern variations, as well as  vegetarian dishes  are increasingly popular in Germany. [38] 
 
 Spices and condiments [ edit ] 
   Quarkkäulchen , a pancake-like dessert with sugar and cinnamon 
 With the exception of mustard for sausages, German dishes are rarely hot and spicy; [39]  the most popular herbs and spices are traditionally  parsley ,  thyme ,  laurel ,  chives ,  black pepper  (used in small amounts),  juniper berries ,  nutmeg , and  caraway . [39]   Cardamom ,  anise seed , and  cinnamon  are often used in sweet cakes or beverages associated with Christmas time, and sometimes in the preparation of sausages, but are otherwise rare in German meals. Other herbs and spices, such as  basil ,  sage ,  oregano , and hot  chili peppers , have become popular since the early 1980s. Fresh  dill  is very common in a green  salad  or fish fillet.
 
   Traditional German mustard 
 Mustard  ( Senf ) is a very common accompaniment to sausages and can vary in strength, [8] [40] [41]  the most common version being  Mittelscharf  (medium hot), which is somewhere between traditional English and French mustards in strength.  Düsseldorf , similar to French's Deli Mustard with a taste that is very different from Dijon, and the surrounding area are known for its particularly spicy mustard, which is used both as a table condiment and in local dishes such as  Senfrostbraten  (pot roast with mustard). [42]  In the southern parts of the country, a sweet variety of mustard is made which is almost exclusively served with the Bavarian speciality  Weißwurst . German mustard is usually considerably less acidic than American varieties.
 Horseradish  is commonly used as a condiment either on its own served as a paste, enriched with cream ( Sahnemeerrettich ), or combined with mustard. [43]  In some regions of Germany, it is used with meats and sausages where mustard would otherwise be used. Its use in Germany has been documented to the 16th century, when it was used as medicine, and as a food, whereby its leaves were consumed as a vegetable. [44] 
 Garlic  has never played a large role in traditional German cuisine, [45]  but has risen in popularity in recent decades due to the influence of  French ,  Italian ,  Spanish ,  Portuguese ,  Greek , and  Turkish  cuisines.  Ramson , a rediscovered herb from earlier centuries, has become quite popular again since the 1990s.
 
 Desserts [ edit ] 
 See also:  List of German desserts 
   Black Forest cake ( German :  Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte ) with cherries on top 
 A wide variety of  cakes ,  tarts  and  pastries  are served throughout the country, [46] [47]  most commonly made with fresh fruit. Apples, plums, strawberries, and cherries are used regularly in cakes.  Cheesecake  is also very popular, often made with  quark .  Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte  (Black Forest cake, made with cherries) is probably the most well-known example of a wide variety of typically German  tortes  filled with whipped or butter cream. [48] 
 
   Rote Grütze with vanilla sauce 
 German  doughnuts  (which have no hole) are usually balls of yeast dough with jam or other fillings, and are known as  Berliner ,  Pfannkuchen  (in Berlin and Eastern Germany), [49]   Kreppel  or  Krapfen , depending on the region. [50] [51]   Eierkuchen  or  Pfannkuchen  are large (usually around 20–24 cm in diameter), and relatively thin (~5mm) pancakes, [52]  comparable to the French  crêpes . They are served covered with sugar, jam or syrup. Salty variants with cheese, ground meat or bacon exist as well as variants with apple slices baked in (called  Apfelpfannkuchen , literally for  apple pancakes ), but they are usually considered to be main dishes rather than desserts. In some regions,  Eierkuchen  are filled and then wrapped; in others, they are cut into small pieces and arranged in a heap (called  Kaiserschmarrn , often including raisins baked in). The word  Pfannkuchen  means pancake in most parts of Germany. [51] 
 A popular dessert in northern Germany is  Rote Grütze , red fruit pudding, which is made with black and red currants, raspberries and sometimes strawberries or cherries cooked in juice with corn starch as a thickener. [53]  It is traditionally served with cream, but also is served with  vanilla  sauce, milk or whipped cream. [53]   Rhabarbergrütze  (rhubarb pudding) [54]  and  Grüne Grütze  (gooseberry fruit pudding) are variations of the  Rote Grütze . A similar dish,  Obstkaltschale , may also be found all around Germany. [55] 
 Ice cream  and  sorbets  are also very popular. [56]  Italian-run ice cream parlours were the first large wave of foreign-run eateries in Germany, which began around the mid-1850s, becoming widespread in the 1920s. [57]   Spaghettieis , which resembles spaghetti, tomato sauce, and ground cheese on a plate, is a popular ice cream dessert. [58] 
 
 Holidays [ edit ] 
 On the Christmas Days following Christmas Eve, roast goose is a staple of Christmas Day meals. [59] [60]  It is sometimes replaced with European carp, [61]  particularly in Southern areas. The carp is cut into pieces, coated in breadcrumbs and fried in fat. Common side dishes are potato salad, cucumber salad or potatoes.

 Apart from Christmas, nearly all other Christian holidays and seasons have special dishes associated with them, varying regionally and by denomination. The Easter season, for instance, is typically associated with painted  Easter eggs ,  Osterbrot  and a meal of freshwater fish on  Good Friday . Likewise,  Saint Sylvester's Day  is often celebrated with a meal of  carp . The  fasting season , which lasts from  Ash Wednesday  to  Easter Sunday , is observed in many areas, especially Catholic ones. The preceding  carnival season  is known for  Berliner Pfannkuchen (German doughnuts) . The last months of the year, especially the  Advent  and Christmas season, is often associated with  Weihnachtsgebäck  (literally Christmas bakery products), which includes sweet and spicy foods like  Weihnachts-/Christstollen ,  Lebkuchen ,  Spekulatius ,  Marzipan ,  Weihnachtsplätzchen ,  Vanillekipferl ,  Zimtsterne  and  Dominosteine . German supermarkets also sell these products during this period. Another popular confectioneries are  Crêpe ,  Reibekuchen  and  Eier-/Pfannkuchen , which are sold in  Christmas markets .
 
 Bread [ edit ] 
 Bread  ( Brot ) is a significant part of German cuisine, with the largest bread diversity in the world. [62]  Around 3000 types of breads [63]  and 1,200 different types of pastries and rolls [64]  are produced in about 13,000 bakeries. [65] 
 
   Roggenmischbrot , also known as  Mischbrot  for short, one of the most typical German breads 
 Bread is served usually for breakfast (often replaced by bread rolls) and in the evening as (open) sandwiches, but rarely as a side dish for the main meal (popular, for example, with  Eintopf  or soup). The importance of bread in German cuisine is also illustrated by words such as  Abendbrot  (meaning supper, literally evening bread) and  Brotzeit  (snack, literally bread time). In fact, one of the major complaints of the German  expatriates  in many parts of the world is their inability to find acceptable local breads. [66] 
 
   Pumpernickel 
 Regarding  bread , German cuisine is more varied than that of any other culture. [62]  Bread types range from white  wheat  bread ( Weißbrot ) to grey ( Graubrot ) to black ( Schwarzbrot ), actually dark brown  rye  bread. [67] [68]  Some breads contain both wheat and rye flour (hence  Mischbrot , mixed bread), [68]  and often also wholemeal and whole seeds such as  linseed ,  sunflower seed , or  pumpkin  seed ( Vollkornbrot ). Darker, rye-dominated breads, such as  Vollkornbrot  or  Schwarzbrot , are typical of German cuisine.  Pumpernickel , sweet-tasting bread created by long-time-steaming instead of regular baking, is internationally well known, although not representative of German black bread as a whole. Most German breads are made with  sourdough . Whole grain is also preferred for high fiber. Germans use almost all available types of grain for their breads: wheat, rye, barley,  spelt , oats, millet, corn and rice. Some breads are even made with  potato starch flour . [69]  A lot of breads are  Multigrain breads .
 Among Germany's most popular breads are  spelt  ( Dinkelbrot ), rye ( Roggenbrot ), rye-wheat ( Roggen mischbrot ), wheat-rye ( Weizenmischbrot ), wheat ( Weißbrot ),  toast  ( Toastbrot ), whole-grain ( Vollkornbrot ), wheat-rye-oats with sesame or linseed ( Mehrkornbrot ), sunflower seeds in dark  rye bread  ( Sonnenblumenkernbrot ), pumpkin seeds in dark rye bread ( Kürbiskernbrot ),  potato bread  ( Kartoffelbrot ) and roasted onions in light wheat-rye bread ( Zwiebelbrot ).
 
 Bread rolls [ edit ] 
   Assortment of German rolls 
 Bread rolls , known in Germany as  Brötchen , [70]  which is a diminutive of  Brot , with regional linguistic varieties being  Semmel  (in South Germany),  Schrippe  (especially in Berlin),  Rundstück  (in the North and Hamburg) or  Wecken ,  Weck ,  Weckle ,  Weckli  and  Weckla  (in  Baden-Württemberg , Switzerland, parts of Southern  Hesse  and northern Bavaria), are common in German cuisine. [71]  A typical serving is a roll cut in half, and spread with butter or margarine. [72]  Cheese, honey, jam,  Nutella , cold cuts such as ham, [72]  fish, or preserves are then placed between the two halves, or on each half separately, known as a  belegtes Brötchen .
 Rolls are also used for snacks, or as a hotdog-style roll for  Bratwurst , Brätel,  Fleischkäse  or  Schwenker / Schwenkbraten .
 Franzbrötchen , which originated in the area of Hamburg, is a small, sweet pastry roll baked with butter and cinnamon. [73] 
 
 Beverages [ edit ] 
 Alcoholic drinks [ edit ] 
 See also:  German wine  and  Beer in Germany 
   German wheat beer 
 Beer  is very common throughout all parts of Germany, with many local and regional breweries producing a wide variety of beers. [74]  The  pale lager   pilsner , a style developed in the mid-19th century, is predominant in most parts of the country today, whereas  wheat beer  ( Weißbier / Weizen ) and other types of  lager  are common, especially in Bavaria. A number of regions have local specialties, many of which, like  Weißbier , are more traditionally brewed  ales . Among these are  Altbier , a dark beer available around Düsseldorf and the lower Rhine,  Kölsch , a similar style, but light in color, in the Cologne area, and the low-alcohol  Berliner Weiße , a  sour beer  made in Berlin that is often mixed with raspberry or woodruff syrup. Since the reunification of 1990,  Schwarzbier , which was common in  East Germany , but could hardly be found in  West Germany , has become increasingly popular in Germany as a whole. Beer may also be mixed with other beverages such as pils or lager and carbonated lemonade:  Radler  (lit: cyclist),  Alsterwasser  (lit: water from the river  Alster ).
 
   German Riesling 
 Since a beer tax law was changed in 1993, many breweries served this trend of mixing beer with other drinks by selling bottles of pre-mixed beverages. Examples are  Bibob  (by  Köstritzer ),  Veltins V+ ,  Mixery  (by Karlsberg), Dimix (by  Diebels ) and  Cab  (by  Krombacher ).
 Cider  is also popular in Germany. It is called  Most  or  Ebbelwoi . In Hessen, people drink it in a  Bembel .
 Wine  is also popular throughout the country.  German wine  comes predominantly from the areas along the upper and middle  Rhine  and its tributaries.  Riesling  and  Silvaner  are among the best-known varieties of white wine, while  Spätburgunder  and  Dornfelder  are important German red wines. The sweet German wines sold in English-speaking countries seem mostly to cater to the foreign market, as they are rare in Germany.
 Korn , a German spirit made from malt (wheat, rye or barley), is consumed predominantly in the middle and northern parts of Germany.  Obstler , on the other hand, distilled from apples and pears, plums, cherries ( Kirschwasser ), or mirabelle plums, is preferred in the southern parts. The term  Schnaps  refers to both kinds of hard liquors.
 All cold drinks in bars and restaurants are sold in glasses with a calibration mark ( Eichstrich ) [75]  that is frequently checked by the  Eichamt  (~ Bureau of Weights and Measures) to ensure the guest is getting as much as is offered in the menu.
 
 Non-alcoholic drinks [ edit ] 
 Coffee  is also very common, [76]  not only for breakfast, but also accompanying a piece of cake ( Kaffee und Kuchen ) in the afternoon, usually on Sundays or special occasions and birthdays. It is generally  filter coffee , which is weaker than  espresso .  Coffeeshops  are also very common in Germany. [77]   Tea  is more common in the northwest. East Frisians traditionally have their tea with cream and rock candy ( Kluntje ). Germany has the tenth highest per capita coffee consumption worldwide. [78] 
 Popular soft drinks include  Schorle , juice or wine mixed with sparkling mineral water, with  Apfelschorle  being popular all over Germany, [79]  and  Spezi , made with cola and an orange-flavored drink such as  Fanta . Germans are unique among their neighbors in preferring  bottled , carbonated  mineral water , either plain ( Sprudel ) or flavored (usually lemon) to noncarbonated ones.
 Drinking water of excellent quality is available everywhere and at any time in Germany. Water provided by the  public water utilities  can be had without hesitation directly from the tap. Usually, no chlorine is added. Drinking water is controlled by state authority to ensure it is potable. Regulations are even stricter than those for bottled water (see  Trinkwasserverordnung ).

 German regional cuisine can be divided into many varieties such as  Bavarian cuisine  (southern Germany) or  Thuringian  (central Germany) and  Lower Saxon cuisine . [80] 
 
 Baden-Württemberg [ edit ] 
 Main articles:  Baden cuisine  and  Swabian cuisine 
   Maultaschen 
 This southwest German state is divided into Baden and Swabia, whose cuisines are slightly different.
Due to Baden's physiogeographical situation in the  Upper Rhine Plain , with Germany's warmest  climate  and fruitful  volcanic soils , it had good prerequisites to develop a high-quality  gastronomy . Nationwide, this region features the highest density of star-rated restaurants; the municipality of  Baiersbronn  is especially well-known for its fine-dining restaurants. Swabian cuisine tends to be heavier than Badish cuisine. Famous dishes of Baden-Württemberg are  Maultaschen ,  Spätzle  and  Black Forest cake .
 
 Bavaria [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Bavarian cuisine 
   Roasted  Schweinshaxe 
 The Bavarian dukes, especially the  Wittelsbach  family, developed Bavarian cuisine and refined it to be presentable to the royal court. This cuisine has belonged to wealthy households, especially in cities, since the 19th century. The (old) Bavarian cuisine is closely connected to  Czech cuisine  and  Austrian cuisine  (especially from  Tyrol  and  Salzburg ), mainly through the Wittelsbach and  Habsburg  families. Already in the beginning, Bavarians were closely connected to their neighbours in Austria through linguistic, cultural and political similarities, which also reflected on the cuisine.
 A characteristic Bavarian cuisine was further developed by both groups, with a distinct similarity to  Franconian  and  Swabian  cuisine. A Bavarian speciality is the  Brotzeit , a savoury snack, which would originally be eaten between breakfast and lunch.
 Bavaria is a part of Southeastern Germany, including the city of Munich and spreading to Germany's borders with Austria and the Czech Republic. The region is located at higher elevations, and is known for yielding beet and potato crops and also for the production of fine beers.
 
 Franconia [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Franconian cuisine 
   Schäufele und Klöße 
 Franconia, a major region consisting roughly of the northern half of  Bavaria , has its own distinct cuisine, so distinct in fact that there is said to be a "White Sausage Equator" ( Weißwurstäquator ) that separates Franconia from the rest of Bavaria. This is a reference to the fact that those north of the Weißwurstequator do not generally eat the popular  Weißwurst  common in southern  Bavaria . A characteristic of Franconian food would include gravies (Soßen), food derived from potatoes, various meats, and, of course, bread. Franconia is well known throughout Germany for its heavy foods covered in gravy. A good example of Franconian food would be  Schäufele  and Klöße, which is a pork shoulder served with traditional potato dumplings (Klöße or Knödel) covered in a gravy.
 
 Hamburg [ edit ] 
 Main articles:  Cuisine of Hamburg ,  Pomeranian cuisine , and  Lower Saxon cuisine 
   A snack typical for Hamburg: brown shrimps on roasted toast bread garnished with dill 
 Due to its centuries-old history as a harbour town, the traditional cuisine of  Hamburg  is very diversified and sapid as the supply of ingredients was safe. Until the 20th century, it was predominantly characterized by the extensive choice of different kinds of  fish  from the river  Elbe  and the quick access to both the  North Sea  and the  Baltic Sea , both being roughly 100 kilometers away from the city center. The neighboring regions supplied the city state with fresh  vegetables ,  fruit  came mainly from a region called  Altes Land  just southwest of Hamburg and until  industrialization , the neighbourhood of  Wilhelmsburg  was considered the ‘milk isle’ of Hamburg.
 International trade made  spices  and exotic food items from  Asia  and  South America  available since the 16th century, and these were soon incorporated into civic kitchens. From this basis, the cuisine of Hamburg developed its current characteristics thanks to the supraregional harmonization of the Northern German and Scandinavian cuisine. Due to its high economic importance, Hamburg features many internationally recognized gourmet restaurants: 11 of them were awarded a  Michelin star  in 2010. [81] 
 
 Hessen [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Hessian cuisine 
   Frankfurter Kranz 
 Typical for Hessen are  Frankfurter Rippchen , a spiked  pork cutlet , which is often served with  sauerkraut  and  mashed potatoes .
 Also from Hessen comes the  Frankfurt green sauce  ( "Grüne Sauce "). It is a cold sauce based on sour cream with the local herbs borage, chervil, cress, parsley, pimpinelle, sorrel and chives. The start of the season is traditionally  Maundy Thursday  ( "Gründonnerstag" ; which means  "green Thursday"  in German). Green sauce is mostly served with potatoes and boiled eggs.
 One of the best-known specialties from Hesse is the  Frankfurter Kranz , a buttercream cake whose shape is reminiscent of a crown; a reminiscence of Frankfurt as the historical coronation city of the  German emperors .
 Cider  ( "Apfelwein"  in German, or  "Äppelwoi"  in the Hessian dialect) is also very popular in and around Frankfurt. In the historic district  Sachsenhausen  there is the so-called Cider Quarter ( "Äppelwoiviertel" ), where there are numerous taverns that offer cider, especially in the summer months. In the cider taverns,  "Handkäs mit Musik"  is offered as a snack, a  sour milk cheese  served in a  marinade  of onions, vinegar and spices.
 
   Pfälzer Saumagen 
 Palatinate/Pfalz [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Palatine cuisine The kitchen of the Palatinate, a region in the south of Rhineland-Palatinate, is largely determined by regional dishes. They are sometimes quite hearty, not least because the cooking recipes were sometimes developed in times of need or in the context of heavy physical work.
 Probably the best-known dish is the  Pfälzer Saumagen , a pork  stomach  stuffed with sausage meat, bacon, potatoes and spices. The dish became famous as the favorite meal of Federal Chancellor  Helmut Kohl , who especially enjoyed serving this dish at state receptions.
 In the Palatinate, the salty-crust  Dampfnudel  is a traditional main dish, either with sweet side dishes (for example wine sauce,  custard  or boiled fruit such as plums, pears or the like) or with salty side dishes (for example potato soup, vegetable soups,  goulash  or pork) is eaten.
 
 Thuringia [ edit ] 
   Thuringian marinated cutlet of pork (Rostbrätel) with pan fried potatoes 
 Wheat ,  grapes ,  sugarbeets , and  barley  grow well, along with a variety of vegetables, which grow near  Erfurt , the state's capital.  Cauliflower  [300 hectares (740 acres)],  cabbage  (savoy, red, white) [10 ha (25 acres)],  kohlrabi  [15 ha (37 acres)], and  broccoli  [15 ha (37 acres)] grow by traditional means near Erfurt.  Tomatoes ,  lettuce ,  broad beans ,  onions , and  cucumbers  are grown in the eastern portion of the region near  Jena  under glass centers on about 5 ha (12 acres) of land.  Thuringia is the second-largest  herb -growing region in Germany; the town of  Kölleda  was once considered the " peppermint  town", where herb growers used to congregate to study herb cultivation. [82] 
 One-third of Thuringia is covered in forest, and is considered to be one of the best game-hunting regions in Germany.  Anyone holding a valid hunting license [83]  and a local hunting permit for the area may hunt for game such as  red deer ,  roe deer ,  wild boar ,  rabbit ,  duck , and  mouflon  (mountain sheep).  Pheasant  and  capercaillie  are protected game species that may not be hunted.  The wooded areas also contain a wide variety of  edible mushrooms , such as chestnut mushrooms,  porcini , and chanterelles, along with wild berries, such as  blueberries ,  cranberries ,  raspberries , and  blackberries , which are all traditional accompaniments to game dishes. [84] 
 The most famous foods from Thuringia are  Thuringian sausages  and  Thuringian dumplings . The state is also known for its  sausages ; steamed, scaled, and cured varieties are all prepared.  Popular varieties include Thüringer  Mettwurst  (a spreadable cured sausage),  Feldkieker  (a cured, air-dried sausage dried up to eight months), Thüringer  Leberwurst  (a steamed pork and liver sausage), Thüringer  Rotwurst  (a steamed blood sausage packed in a bladder or other natural casing) [85]  and  Mett  (minced pork).
 
 Saxony [ edit ] 
 Main articles:  Saxon cuisine  and  Ore Mountain cuisine 
   Sächsische Kartoffelsuppe (potato soup) 
 In general the cuisine is very hearty and features many peculiarities of central Germany such as a great variety of  sauces  which accompany the  main dish  and the fashion to serve  Klöße  or  Knödel  as a  side dish  instead of  potatoes ,  pasta  or  rice . Also much  freshwater fish  is used in Saxon cuisine, particularly  carp  and  trout  as is the case throughout  Central  and  Eastern Europe .
 The rich history of the region did and still does influence the cuisine. In the blossoming and growing cities of  Dresden  and  Leipzig  an extravagant style of cuisine is cherished (one may only think of the  crab  as an ingredient in the famous  Leipziger Allerlei ). In other, impoverished regions where the people had to work hard to yield some harvest (e.g., the  Erzgebirge ), peasant dishes play a major role; famous dishes originating from there include  potatoes  with  Quark , potato soup or potato with  bread  and  linseed oil . In the  Vogtland  region, where the peasants were wealthier, the tradition of  Sunday roast  remains to this day.
 Cereal grain  cultivation occupies 62% of the cultivated land in  Saxony-Anhalt .  Wheat ,  barley ,  oats , and  rye  are grown, with the rye being grown near  Borde , where it is used to make  Burger Knäckebrot , a flatbread produced there since 1931. Another 10% of the cultivated area is planted in  sugar beets  for conversion to sugar, popularized after the 19th century, when the region had an economic boom. [86] 
 
 International influences [ edit ] 
 Elements of international cuisine (apart from influences from neighbouring countries) are a relatively recent phenomenon in German cuisine, compared with other West European states.  Colonial goods shops  spread only in the 19th and early 20th centuries and brought luxury goods like cocoa, coconuts, rare exotic spices, coffee and (non-herbal) tea to a wider audience.
 The first wave of foreigners coming to Germany specifically to sell their food specialties were ice cream makers from northern Italy, who started to arrive in noticeable numbers during the late 1920s. With the post-World War II contacts with Allied occupation troops, and especially with the influx of more and more foreign workers that began during the second half of the 1950s, many foreign dishes have been adopted into German cuisine —  Italian  dishes, such as  spaghetti  and  pizza , have become staples of the German diet. [87]  In 2008, there were around 9,000 pizzerias and 7,000 Italian restaurants in Germany. [87]  The pizza is Germany's favourite fast food. [88] 
 Turkish immigrants  have introduced  Turkish foods  to Germany, [89] [87]  notably  döner kebab . [90] [91]  In November 2017, it was estimated that 1,500 döner kebab shops were present in  Berlin  and in circa 16,000 in whole Germany. [91] 
 Arab  (mostly  Syrian ,  Lebanese  or  Moroccan ),  Chinese , [92]   Balkan ,  Japanese  (especially  Sushi ) and  Greek  (especially  Gyros ) [93]  restaurants and bars are also widespread in Germany. [94] 
 Indian  (especially  Curry  dishes), [95]   Vietnamese ,  Thai , and other Asian cuisines are rapidly gaining in popularity since the early 2000s. Until the late 1990s many of the more expensive restaurants served mostly French inspired dishes for decades. Since the end of the 1990s, they have been shifting to a more refined form of German cuisine.
 Before 1990, the cuisine from  East Germany  (1949–1990) was influenced by those of other nations within the former  Communist bloc . East Germans traveled abroad to these countries on holiday (and vice versa as well), and soldiers coming to East Germany from these countries brought their dishes with them. A typical dish that came to the East German kitchen this way is  Russian   Soljanka .
 
 Food industry [ edit ] 
 Germany is the third largest agricultural producer in the European Union [96]  and the third largest agricultural exporter in the world. In 2013, German food exports were worth around EUR 66 billion. [97]  Several food products are internationally known brands. [98]
