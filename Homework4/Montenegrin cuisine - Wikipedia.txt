 Montenegrin cuisine  is a result of  Montenegro 's geographic position and its long  history  and tradition.
 
 
 Review [ edit ] 
   Foods from Montenegro 
 The first major influences to Montenegrin cuisine came from the  Levant  and  Turkey , largely via  Serbia :  sarma ,  musaka ,  pilav ,  pita ,  gibanica ,  burek ,  ćevapi ,  kebab ,  đuveč , and Turkish sweets such as  baklava  and  tulumba .
 Hungarian cuisine  influences  stews  and  sataraš .  Central European cuisine  is evident in the prevalence of  crêpes ,  doughnuts ,  jams , many types of  biscuits  and  cakes , and various kinds of breads.
 Montenegrin cuisine also varies geographically; the cuisine in the coastal area differs from that of the northern highland region. The coastal area is traditionally a representative of  Mediterranean cuisine , with  seafood  being a common dish. The traditional dishes of Montenegro's  Adriatic coast , unlike its heartland, have a distinctively  Italian  influence as well. [1] 
 
 Common dishes [ edit ] 
 Bread [ edit ] 
 Homemade-style bread prepared in Montenegro is closest to what is known in Italy as pane casareccio. It is served with every meal. Types include ječmeni ( barley bread ), ražani ( rye bread ), pšenični ( wheat bread ), and rumetinov ( corn bread ).
 
 Breakfast [ edit ] 
 Cicvara - stewed  cornmeal  with  kaymak  (salted and then compressed fresh cream) and  čvarci  (cracklings). 
 Gibanica  with  yoghurt  or  kisjelo mlijeko  (buttermilk). 
 Popara  and bread with  kajmak 
 Pršut  (most notable is  njeguški pršut ) 
 Soups [ edit ] 
 Montenegrin language distinguishes between a clear soup ( supa , pronounced  [ˈsupə] ), a thick soup or stew ( čorba , pronounced  [ˈtʃɔrbə] ), and a porridge-style dish ( kaša , pronounced  [ˈkəʃə] ). Soups are usually served as the first course of  lunch  at midday:
 
 Kokošija supa (chicken  broth ) 
 Goveđa/juneća/teleća supa (beef/calf broth) 
 Jagnjeća supa (lamb broth) 
 Traditionally, after the broth is made, a handful of  rice  is added to the pot to make the soup more substantial. Nowadays,  pasta  has taken over as the preferred addition.
 
 Čorba od koprive ( nettle  chowder) 
 Čorba od koprive sa sirom (nettle chowder with  cheese ) 
 Čobanska krem supa od vrganja (shepherd cream soup with  mushrooms  ( boletus ))
