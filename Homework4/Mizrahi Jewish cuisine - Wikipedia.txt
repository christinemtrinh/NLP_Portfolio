 Assortment of cooking traditions of Mizrahi Jews 
 Further information:  Jewish cuisine ,  Sephardic Jewish cuisine ,  Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine ,  Ethiopian Jewish cuisine ,  Bukharan Jewish cuisine ,  Syrian Jewish cuisine , and  Israeli cuisine 
   Iraqi-Jewish cuisine,  kubbeh matfuniya 
 Mizrahi Jewish cuisine  is an assortment of cooking traditions that developed among the Jews of the  Middle East ,  North Africa ,  Asia , and Arab countries.  Mizrahi Jews  have also been known as Oriental Jews ( Mizrahi  is Hebrew: Eastern or Oriental). 
 Jews of the Mizrahi communities cook foods that were and are popular in their home countries, while following the laws of  kashrut . The cuisine is based largely on fresh ingredients, as marketing was done in the local  souq . 
 Meat is ritually slaughtered in the  shechita  process, and is soaked and salted. Meat dishes are a prominent feature of  Shabbat , festival, and celebratory meals. 
 Cooked, stuffed and baked vegetables are central to the cuisine, as are various kinds of beans, chickpeas, lentils and burghul (cracked wheat). Rice takes the place of potatoes.
 
 
 History [ edit ] 
   Tahina  with lemon and garlic, a staple of Mizrahi Jewish cuisine as a dip or cooking sauce 
 Mizrahi Jews are the Jews of the Middle East, and points south and east, largely along the Mediterranean coastal areas and the Levant.  In some countries, there was much mixing of populations after 1492 when the  Jews were expelled from Spain .
 Cuisine of the Mizrahi Jews includes the cuisines of the  Jews of Iraq ,  Syria ,  Lebanon ,  Yemen ,  Iran  (Persia),  Afghanistan ,  Egypt , the  Berber  communities,  Kurdistan ,  Eastern Caucasus and Georgia .
 Some of these communities and cuisine styles overlap with Sephardic communities who fled to many Eastern, Middle-Eastern, and North African countries after the Spanish expulsion.
 Coming from the Mediterranean and "sunny" climes, Mizrahi cuisine is often light, with an emphasis on salads, stuffed vegetables and vine leaves, olive oil, lentils, fresh and dried fruits, herbs and nuts, and chickpeas. 
 Meat dishes often make use of lamb or ground beef. Fresh lemon juice is added to many soups and sauces. Many meat and rice dishes incorporate dried fruits such as apricots, prunes and raisins. Pine nuts are used as a garnish. Pomegranate juice is a staple of Persian-Jewish cooking.
 Kubbeh , a meat-stuffed bulgur dumpling, features in the cooking of many Mizrahi communities. It is served in the cooking broth, as a kind of soup.
 
 Breads [ edit ] 
   Lahoh , a spongy, pancake-like bread that originated from Somalia and the Horn of Africa 
 Flatbreads  of many varieties are central to middle eastern cooking. Various flatbreads such as  pitas ,  laffa ,  malawah , and  lavash  are used instead of  challah , which was only used by Ashkenazim of Europe, and in the Turban-shaped variety by Moroccan Jews.  Lahoh  is a flatbread of the Yemenite Jews with a spongy texture. [1] 
 
 Herbs, spices and seasoning blends [ edit ] 
   Couscous  with vegetables and chickpeas 
 Mizrahi cuisine makes liberal use of cumin, pepper, sesame seeds, and various spices common to all Middle-Eastern cuisines. [2]   Saffron, a staple of Sephardic cuisine, is also featured in certain Mizrahi dishes.
 Many foods are flavored with seasoning blends or pastes, and light sauces.  Hilbah , a paste made from  fenugreek  seeds and hot pepper, is added to soups and other traditional Yemenite dishes. [3]   Skhug , a hot pepper sauce, comes in red and green varieties. A diluted version of  skhug  is spooned over  falafel .  Hawaij  is a Yemenite spice mixture that comes into two varieties. One, a blend of powdered ginger, cinnamon, cloves and cardamom, is added to coffee and baked goods. The other, a blend of turmeric, black pepper, onion, cumin, cardamom and cloves, is added to soup.
 Pastes and sauces are very often served on the side in small dishes on the table during meals, to be added by each diner as desired. Certain spice combinations are characteristic of particular countries, such as coriander and cumin in Egyptian cuisine. [4] 
 The  souqs  of the Middle East and North Africa sell ready-made spice blends sold in bulk, but traditionally, Mizrahi Jews bought fresh herbs and prepared their own blends at home to maintain  kashrut , fearing insects in the blends sold in the open-air bazaar. [5] 
 
 Adeni hawaij  (Aden)—cumin, coriander, black pepper 
 Adeni black tea spice (Aden)—cardamom, cinnamon, cloves 
 Advieh-e halegh ,  halegh  ( charoset ) (Iran)—may contain: cinnamon, cloves, ginger, nutmeg, and cardamom (optional) [6] 
 Hawaij  (Yemen)—black pepper, cardamom, turmeric, saffron 
 Kama  (Morocco)—black pepper, cumin, ginger, turmeric, nutmeg 
 Quatre épices  or four spices (Egypt)—cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, cloves 
 Za'tar  or  zahtar— za'atar , thyme or hyssop with ground sesame seeds, sumac and salt 
 Desserts [ edit ] 
   Kanafeh Nabulsieh  from  Nablus 
 Hot  sahlab , a liquidy cornstarch pudding originally flavored with orchid powder (today invariably replaced by artificial flavorings), is served in cups as a winter drink, garnished with cinnamon, nuts, coconut and raisins.  Arak  from the anis drinks family, is the preferred alcoholic beverage. Rosewater is a common ingredient in cakes and desserts.  Malabi , a cold cornstarch pudding, is sprinkled with rosewater and red syrup. 
 Ikaddaif  or  kadaif  is a very sweet pastry similar in style and technique to  baklavah . It consists of shredded dough, which is wrapped around crushed nuts, baked and then soaked in syrup. It is common in various parts of the Middle East and is served at festive meals. [7] 
 
 Cooking techniques [ edit ] 
 As cooking on  Shabbat  is prohibited, Mizrahi Jews take advantage of slow-cooking techniques, such as baking on a low temperature overnight, to have available hot dishes on the Sabbath.  This technique is virtually universal to all Jewish cuisines.  One staple of this technique is  hamin  or  chamin  (from the word  kham , which means "hot"). 
 In  North Africa  this dish is known as  dafina . There are many varieties of  hamin  and  dafina , as particularly local spices and ingredients are used, as well as the method of preparation.  Some varieties are denser than others, and some use rice as a staple instead of the common root vegetables.
 Bourekas  are often served on Shabbat morning. In Yemenite cooking, Shabbat dishes include  jachnun  and  kubbanah .
 
 Shabbat and holiday cooking [ edit ] 
 Shabbat [ edit ] 
 Shabbat  foods are often slow-cooked prior to Shabbat, and kept warm overnight once cooked, as cooking is forbidden on Shabbat by Jewish Law.  In Yemenite cooking, Shabbat dishes include  jachnun  and  kubaneh .
 
 Passover [ edit ] 
   Charoset 
 Mizrahi  cuisine allows the use of  kitniyot , which is forbidden amongst the  Ashkenazim .  Kitniyot  are legumes and some grains, which include rice and a variety of beans and pulses. 
 Whereas  charoset  in Ashkenazi homes is a blend of chopped apples and nuts spiced with wine and cinnamon, Mizrahi  charoset  is often based on dried fruits, especially dates, and is much thicker in consistency.
 Other Mizrahi Jewish dishes are  tebit , a chicken and rice dish, and  ingriyi , sweet and sour meat topped with aubergines, both from the cuisine of Iraqi Jews.
 
 Rosh Hashanah [ edit ] 
 Makroudh  are pastries stuffed with spiced dates and scented with orange-flower water prepared for  Rosh Hashanah  by Algerian Jews. 
 Slow-cooked vegetables stuffed with meat are a popular holiday dish. Moroccan Jews season the stuffing with cinnamon, turmeric, and nutmeg. Holiday meals start with at least a dozen small salads. [8]
