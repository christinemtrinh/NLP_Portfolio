 Panamanian cuisine  is a mix of African, Spanish, and  Native American  techniques, dishes, and ingredients, reflecting its diverse population. Since  Panama  is a land bridge between two continents, it has a large variety of tropical fruits, vegetables and herbs that are used in native cooking.
 Common ingredients in Panamanian food are maize, rice, wheat flour,  plantains ,  yuca  ( cassava ), beef,  chicken , pork and seafood. [1] [2]

 Corn-based dishes come from the kernel, cooked in water and then ground in order to obtain a dough (as opposed to using corn flour to obtain the dough). Fresh corn is also used in some dishes. Due to the multicultural background of the Panamanians, many of its dishes are heavily influenced by the cuisine of other Latin American countries and also the Caribbean as well as European. Some of the main meals, dishes and specialties include:
 
 Almojábanos – "S" shaped corn fritters. [3]

 In Panama there were bars that catered to local businessmen, tourists and gamblers and some that were frequented by US military personnel. The latter mostly had a reputation as "shot and beer" dives with unknown names. One of these bars, Kresch's Place published a drink recipe book. Several of the drinks are named after bases, submarines, forts, ships and other military institutions. The "U.S.S. 44 Special" was  Old Tom gin ,  sloe gin  and lime juice. The U.S.S. Mallard was aged rum (Panamanian, Venezuelan and Colombian), red  vermouth ,  Bénédictine ,  absinthe ,  Angostura bitters  garnished with lemon peel. The cover of the recipe book shows soldiers, sailors and an Army officer drinking. [22]

An easy one consists of two cans of  condensed milk , three cans of  evaporated milk , six eggs, and a half a bottle of  rum  and  nutmeg  for some extra flavor.
