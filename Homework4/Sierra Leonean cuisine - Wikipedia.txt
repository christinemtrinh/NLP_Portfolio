 Culinary traditions of Sierra Leone 
 Sierra Leonean cuisine  consists of the  cooking  traditions and practices from  Sierra Leone . It follows the traditions of other  West African cuisines . The country has 16 tribal ethnic groups. [1] 
 
 
 Overview [ edit ] 
   Unprocessed  cassava  root 
 The most commonly eaten food in Sierra Leone is  rice , which is typically served as part of every meal eaten, [2]  and is considered so ubiquitous that many Sierra Leoneans consider 
that a meal is not complete without it. [3]  Another popular staple food is  cassava , which is pounded to make  fufu ; [2]  the leaves of the cassava are formed into a green stew. [3] 
 Palm oil  and  peanuts  are also widely eaten, [3]  and while  yams  are found in Sierra Leone, they are not a mainstay of the diet as they are in other parts of  West Africa . [2]  Other staples in the Sierra Leonean diet are  bananas ,  cinnamon ,  coconut ,  ginger ,  okra ,  plantains  and  tamarind .
 Commonly eaten meats include  goat ,  chicken  and  beef , and there are also a number of dishes using pork as an added ingredient. [4] 
 Oranges , bananas,  papayas ,  lemons ,  avocados ,  guava ,  watermelons ,  mangoes , and  pineapples  are fruits commonly eaten by Sierra Leoneans. [5]

 Stews [ edit ] 
   Stir-fried  okra 
 Stews  are a fundamental part of Sierra Leone's cuisine, with cassava leaves having been called the country's national dish. [6]  Stew is often served with  jollof rice , white rice or snacks such as plantain,  akara , yam or cassava. Groundnut stew, also called  peanut stew  or  peanut soup , often has chicken and vegetables included. [7]  This is often served to families as a large meal. [ citation needed ] 
 
 Cassava leaves [ edit ] 
 Cassava  leaves are an important cooking ingredient in Sierra Leone and considered the primary staple food. [6]  In preparation, the tenderest cassava leaves are washed, then either pounded very finely or bruised with a  pestle and mortar , and then finely shredded before cooking. The leaves are added to  palaver sauce , which is made using red  palm oil  mixed with other ingredients, such as  onions ,  pepper ,  fish ,  meat , and  vegetables  to create a  stew . The stew is a favorite among Sierra Leoneans at home and abroad. To give the dish a more exquisite taste,  coconut oil  may be used instead of palm oil. [8] 
 
 Beverages [ edit ] 
   GT Ginger Beer 
 Ginger beer  is typically a homemade  non-alcoholic beverage , made out of pure  ginger , and sweetened with  sugar  to taste.  Cloves  and  lime juice  are sometimes added for flavor. [9]
