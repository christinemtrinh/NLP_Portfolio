 Pacific Northwest cuisine  is a  North American   cuisine  of the states of  Oregon ,  Washington  and  Alaska , as well as the  province  of  British Columbia  and the southern portion of the territory of  Yukon ,  reflecting the ethnic makeup of the region, with noticeable influence from  Asian  and  Native American  traditions. With significant migration from other regions of the US, influences from  Southern cuisine  brought by  African Americans  as well as  Mexican-American cuisine  as Latinos migrate north from California, can be seen as well. [1] 
 Seattle 's  Pike Place Market  is notable regarding this culinary style, along with  Portland  and  Vancouver . Former  restaurant critic  of  The New York Times   Frank Bruni  wrote of Seattle in June 2011, "I'm hard-pressed to think of another corner or patch of the United States where the  locavore  sensibilities of the moment are on such florid (and often sweetly funny) display, or where they pay richer dividends, at least if you're a lover of fish." [2] 
 
 
 Foods and dishes [ edit ] 
 Common ingredients include  salmon ,  shellfish , and other fresh  seafood ,  game  meats such as  moose ,  elk , or  caribou ,  wild mushrooms ,  berries , small  fruits ,  potatoes ,  kale , and wild plants such as  fiddlehead ferns  and even young  pushki .  Smoking fish  or grilling seafood on  cedar  planks are techniques often used in this cuisine. [3]  Since the 1980s, Northwest cuisine has begun to emphasize the use of locally produced craft beer and wine. 
 There is generally an emphasis on fresh ingredients, simply prepared. [4]  Unlike other cuisine styles, there are various recipes for each dish with none being considered more or less correct than the others. This has led some food writers to question whether it truly is a "cuisine" in the traditional sense of the word. [5] 
 Many  food carts  and  food trucks  in the Northwest specialize in  fusion cuisine , such as  bulgogi   burritos , deep-fried  sushi rolls ,  Korean tacos  and "Japanese-style"  hot dogs . [6]  Other foods found in Seattle with a heavy Asian influence include a unique style of teriyaki, [7]  along with a sushi roll with salmon and cream cheese (the  Seattle roll ). [8]  Food carts also spawned the  Seattle Dog , a hot dog with cream cheese. [9]
