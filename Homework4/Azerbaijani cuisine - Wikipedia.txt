 Azerbaijani cuisine  ( Azerbaijani :  Azərbaycan mətbəxi ) refers to the cooking styles and dishes of the Republic of  Azerbaijan . The cuisine developed significantly due to its diversity of agriculture, from abundant grasslands which historically allowed for a culture of  pastoralism  to develop, as well as to the unique geographical location of Azerbaijan, which is situated on the crossroads of Europe and Asia with an access to the  Caspian Sea . The location has enabled the people to develop a varied diet rich in produce, milk products, and meat, including beef, mutton, fish and  game . The location, which was contended over by many historical kingdoms, khanates, and empires, also meant that Azerbaijani cuisine was influenced by the culinary traditions of multiple different cultures, such as  Turkic ,  Iranian , and  Eastern European .
 
 
 History and features of Azerbaijan national cuisine [ edit ]

 Azerbaijan's national cuisine is closer to  Middle Eastern cuisine  due to the taste and preparation of the dishes, as well as adding a dark spice and flavor additives. [ clarification needed ] 
Contemporary Azerbaijan cuisine retains the traditional methods of preparing dishes while incorporating modern cooking.
 Azerbaijani dishes have traditionally been cooked with copper utensils and cookware. Copper bowls and plates are still commonly used as serving dishes.
 Azerbaijani cuisine utilizes fruits and vegetables such as  aubergine ,  tomato ,  sweet pepper ,  spinach ,  cabbage , onion,  sorrel ,  beet ,  radish ,  cucumber , and  green beans . Rice and products made from  flour  are widely used in national cuisine. Fresh herbs, including  mint ,  coriander ,  dill ,  basil ,  parsley ,  tarragon ,  leek ,  chive ,  thyme ,  marjoram ,  green onion , and  watercress  often accompany main dishes. The majority of national dishes are made with lamb, beef and poultry meat. Dishes prepared of minced meat are also prevalent. The sea, lakes and rivers of Azerbaijan are abundant with different fish species, particularly the  white sturgeon . Sturgeons are widely used in preparation of national dishes. Particularly, the Caspian Sea is home to many edible species of fish, including the  sturgeon ,  Caspian salmon ,  kutum ,  sardines ,  grey mullet , and others. Black  caviar  from the Caspian Sea is one of Azerbaijan's best-known luxury foods.
 The typical Azerbaijani meal involves three courses. One of the basic dishes of Azerbaijani cuisine is  plov  prepared with  saffron -covered rice, served with various herbs and greens, a combination distinct from those found in  Uzbek  plovs. Other second courses include a variety of  kebabs  and  shashlik , including  lamb , beef, chicken,  duck  and fish ( baliq ) kebabs. Sturgeon, a common fish, is normally skewered and grilled as a shashlik, served with a tart pomegranate sauce called  narsharab .  Dried fruits  and  walnuts  are used in many dishes. The traditional  condiments  are salt,  black pepper ,  sumac , and especially saffron, which is grown on the  Absheron Peninsula  domestically. The third courses include soups, of which there are more than 30 types. These include  kufta bozbash ,  piti  prepared of meat and  dovga , ovdukh, dogramach, bolva prepared of greens and yoghurt. Some soups are served in national or interesting and unusually-shaped bowls [ clarification needed ] .
 Black tea  is the national beverage, and is drunk after food is eaten. It is also offered to guests as a gesture of welcome, often accompanied by  fruit preserves . [1] 
 
 Breakfast [ edit ] 
 The Azerbaijani breakfast is heavy in dairy products such as butter, various types of white cheese, and cream, as well as honey, tandoori bread and eggs, traditionally prepared into  kuku , but alternatively, also scrambled. [2]  Eastern European breakfast traditions which were adopted under the  Russian Empire  and the  Soviet Union  are also occasionally seen in Azerbaijan households, with foods such as  kasha ,  porridge ,  quark  and  crepes  included on the breakfast table.
 
 Light snacks [ edit ] 
   Azerbaijani light snacks 
 Azerbaijani cuisine has a number of light snacks and  side dishes  to open or accompany the main meals: a plate of green leaves called  goy , pieces of  chorek  (bread),  choban  (a tomato and cucumber  salad ),  white cheese  or  qatik  (sour yogurt) and  turshu  (pickles). [3]  This culinary tradition is comparable to Turkish  meze . The richer main courses such as soups, meats and plov are served afterwards. [3] 
 
 Dishes [ edit ] 
   Dolma 
   Gürzə 
   Dovga 
 Meat [ edit ] 
   Badımcan dolması 
   Azerbaijani  dushbara Historically, Azerbaijani cuisine included large amounts of beef and  game . Consumption of camel meat was also widespread, although it has become increasingly rare in modern times. In order to preserve meat, it was historically jerked, or alternatively, roasted and stuffed into jars or animal stomachs. Apart from the conventional cuts of meat, Azerbaijani cuisine features the use of head, legs, tails and intestines of animals in numerous traditional dishes. [4] 
 Azerbaijani cuisine features a wide variety of traditional meat dishes such as  bozbash   (parchabozbash, kuftebozbash, qovurmabozbash),  piti  (gence piti, sheki piti)  khash , bash-ayaq (kelle-pacha), kelepir, soyutma, bozport, buglama, bozartma,  and a variety of different kebabs. A variety of lamb dishes are also commonly eaten, traditionally during celebrations such as  Nowruz . Meatball dishes and forms of  dolma  are regularly eaten as well. On particularly special occasions, local goose, turkey, duck, quail and pheasant meats are also cooked and consumed.
 Azerbaijani cuisine also features a variety of seafood, especially fish which is obtained from the Caspian Sea as well as the  Kura  and  Aras  rivers. Fish is prepared in a variety of ways: stuffed, chopped, dried, grilled, fried, boiled, cooked in the oven, cooked on skewers, cooked in  tandoors , cooked into  plovs , and in other ways depending on the occasion and personal preferences. [4]

 Soups [ edit ] 
 Soups in Azerbaijan tend to have a thicker consistency and a larger ratio of dry ingredients to broth. [4]  A common feature of numerous Azerbaijani soups is that the soup serves the role of both the first and second courses [4]  – the soup is served in a large portion and the broth is drunk first as a starter, and then the dry ingredients of the soup such as the potatoes, meat, chickpeas and large vegetable chunks are consumed as a second course together with bread.
 Another characteristic featured in several Azerbaijani soups is the use of finely cut mutton tails which are added soups. Tomato paste and tomato puree are rarely used in Azerbaijani soups and instead are substituted with fresh local tomatoes during the summer. [4]  During winter, local tomatoes are not widely available and so frequently substituted with dried cherries. Spices such as saffron and turmeric powder are also traditionally used in Azerbaijani soups.

 Plov  is one of the most widespread dishes in Azerbaijan and there are over 200 types of plovs in Azerbaijani cuisine. They are usually prepared with local vegetables, meats and spices. In Azerbaijani tradition, it is customary that the household prepares a plov for guests visiting the house. [10]  They are typically served in a large metal or porcelain bowl covered with a lid to keep it warm. The type of rice used to make the plov varies from one recipe to another and depends on personal preferences. Since plov is a heavy, fatty food, it is traditionally served together with sour drinks such as ayran, black tea with lemon, or verjuice. Plovs have different names depending on the main ingredients accompanying the rice:

[12]  Other spices widely used in Azerbaijani cuisine include  anise ,  cumin ,  cinnamon ,  thyme ,  coriander seeds ,  curcuma ,  sumac ,  caraway ,  bay leaves ,  mint ,  dill ,  parsley ,  celery ,  tarragon  and  basil . [13] 
 
 Desserts [ edit ] 
   Shorgoghal 
   Quba pakhlavasi 
   Badambura [14] 
   Azerbaijani pakhlava  and  shekerbura 
 Typical Azerbaijani desserts are sticky, syrup-saturated pastries such as  pakhlava  and  Shaki halva . The former, a layer of  chopped nuts  sandwiched between mats of thread-like fried dough, is a specialty of  Shaki  in northwest Azerbaijan. Other traditional pastries include  shekerbura  (crescent-shaped and filled with nuts),  peshmak  (tube-shaped candy made out of  rice ,  flour , and  sugar ), and  girmapadam  (pastry filled with chopped nuts).
 Sweets are generally bought from a pastry shop and eaten at home or on special occasions such as weddings and wakes. The usual conclusion to a restaurant meal is a plate of fresh fruit that is in season, such as  plums ,  cherries ,  apricots , or  grapes .
 In March 2009, Azerbaijani bakers achieved an entry in the CIS book of records for baking the biggest and heaviest pakhlava in the CIS, weighing about 3 tons. More than 7 thousand eggs, 350 kg of nuts, 20 kg of almonds, 350 kg of sugar, and the same amount of flour was used in the preparation of the pastry. [15] 
 
 
 
 Name
 
 Description
 
 
 Pakhlava 
 
 The name of this pastry is derived from its diamond shape, symbolizing fire, which is called pakhla by Azerbaijani carpet specialists. It is one of the festive sweets baked on the eve of the arrival of Spring- the  Nowruz  holiday to honour the  sun .
 
 
 Shekerbura 
 
 Shekerbura ( şəkərbura ) is a popular Azerbaijani sweet pastry, filled with ground  almonds ,  hazelnuts , or  walnuts . The ancient name for this crescent-shaped pastry is Sheker Burek, a Turkic word meaning ‘sweet  patty ’. In Azerbaijan, it usually involves the teamwork of relatives, friends, and neighbors who congregate at someone's home to make this.  Nowruz  delights. What really makes these look rather spectacular is the pattern on the dough produced by the traditional tweezers called maggash.
 
 
 Samani halva 
 
 Samani halva is made from malted  wheat , and can be best described as a spicy, gooey, chewy treat. One samani halva tradition in Azerbaijan is to make halva communally, using  flour  from seven different homes. [16] 
 
 
 Shorgoghal 
 
 Another Novruz delicacy, Shorgoghal is a flaky pastry filled with  turmeric ,  anise ,  caraway ,  cinnamon  and  black pepper . In ancient times, the yellow  pastry  represented the  sun , while the crescent-shaped  Shekerbura  represented the  moon . These rolls are time-consuming to prepare, but the process is not really complicated.
 
 
 Guymag 
 
 This is a simple, rich dessert, traditionally offered to women who have just given birth or to patients after surgery to keep their strength up. It is high in calories and easy to prepare. It is also served as a hot breakfast when the weather is cold.
 
 
 Firni 
 
 Firni is a dessert made from rice flour, which has a light texture and bland flavor, making it much lighter than British and North American baked  rice puddings . [17] 
 
 
 Badambura 
 
 Badambura is slightly less sweet than pakhlava and has no honey so it is less sticky as well. It is filled with plain ground sugar, almonds (badam in Azerbaijani language), cardamom, and vanilla. [18] 
 
 Dairy products [ edit ] 
   Qatiq 
 Milk and dairy products play an important role in the Azerbaijani diet. Milk, butter, cream, sour cream, yogurt, cottage cheese, motal cheese, buttermilk,  dovga ,  ayran ,  qatiq , suzme, and other dairy products are regularly consumed in the morning, as a snack, and even incorporated into lunch and dinner. Cow's milk is most often used to produce local dairy products, however sheep's milk is also sometimes used and goats' milk is consumed for its perceived health benefits. Rural communities in Azerbaijan produce local butter, buttermilk and cheeses using traditional churning techniques.

In the  Middle Ages ,  tandoor  ovens were one of the common facilities of the population who lived in  Old City  (Icheri Sheher). This has been discovered during the archaeological excavations in different areas of Old City.
During the meeting held in Ethiopia, the  UNESCO  Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of the  Intangible Cultural Heritage  decided to include  lavash  in the Representative List of the  Intangible Cultural Heritage  of the organization. [19] [20]

 Alcoholic beverages [ edit ] 
 Unlike multiple other countries with a predominantly Muslim population, alcohol consumption in Azerbaijan is entirely legal, and a variety of alcoholic drinks, both locally produced and imported can be found in shops and bars across the country. Although alcohol consumption in Azerbaijan is relatively moderate, [25]  alcoholic drinks still play a part in nightlife, festivities and celebrations.
 
   Chabiant Azerbaijani wine 
 Wine [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Azerbaijani wine 
 Azerbaijan produces wine locally. In the  Khanlar district  of the Azerbaijan Republic, for example, archeologists have found jars buried with the remains of wine dating back to the 2nd millennium BC. Greek historian  Strabo  who had traveled to northern Azerbaijan ( Caucasian Albania  at the time) described cultivation of crops of grapes as so abundant that the residents were not able to harvest them [ citation needed ] . One of the most ancient and notable regions known for its wine-making produce is  Tovuz  in northwestern Azerbaijan. Archeological findings in this region speak of ancient vessels for wine storage, stones and remains of  tartaric acid  used for wine-growing. [26] 
 The contemporary wine-making in Azerbaijan is seen in  Ganja - Qazakh  and  Shirvan  economic zones. [27]  Vineyards in these regions account to about 7% of the country's cultivated land. The regions are famous for 17 vines and 16 table grape varieties, the most common of the wine cultivars being  Pinot Noir . [28]  In Azerbaijan, wines made from  grapes  are called  sharab  ( Azerbaijani :  şərab ) while wines from other fruits including apples,  pomegranates  and  mulberry  are called  nabiz  ( Azerbaijani :  nəbiz ). Other sorts are called  chakhyr  ( Azerbaijani :  çaxır ). According to historians, there are more than 450 different categories of wild grape found in Azerbaijan which had been used for wine-making throughout the history of Azerbaijan. [29] 
 
 Beer [ edit ] 
 Azerbaijan is a small-scale domestic beer producer and various types of beer, locally produced and imported, are widely available in shops and supermarkets across the country. Pubs serving beer can also be found scattered across  Baku , where locals typically consume beer together with various snacks such as  crepes ,  croutons , fried fish or chicken, and salted nuts.
 
 Vodka [ edit ] 
 Vodka is another common beverage that can be found in Azerbaijani stores and bars. The practice of consuming vodka is a part of the  Eastern European  influence left in Azerbaijan after nearly two centuries of being a part of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union.
 
 Pickles [ edit ] 
 Consumption of pickled foods, particularly pickled vegetables, is common in Azerbaijan. A plate of pickled foods is served as one of the snacks prior to the main dish, or alternatively as a side dish.
 
 
 
 
 
 Pickled plums
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Pickled tomatoes
 
 
 
 
 Fruit preserves [ edit ] 
 Fruit preserves of all kinds, traditionally served alongside tea, are a ubiquitous sighting at family gatherings and festivities in Azerbaijan. Jams, jellies, and especially fruit conserves are eaten in between sips of tea or sometimes placed directly into tea as a sweetener and a flavoring.
