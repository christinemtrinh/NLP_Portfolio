 Italian-American cuisine  ( Italian :  Cucina italoamericana ) is a style of Italian cuisine adapted throughout the  United States . Italian-American food has been shaped throughout history by various waves of immigrants and their descendants, called  Italian Americans .
 As immigrants from the different  regions of Italy  settled throughout the various  regions of the United States , many brought with them a distinct regional Italian culinary tradition. Many of these foods and recipes developed into new favorites for the townspeople and later for Americans nationwide.
 
 
 Traditional influences [ edit ] 
   Risotto 
 Italian-American food is based primarily on the culinary traditions of  Southern Italian   immigrants , although a significant number of  Northern Italian  immigrants also came to the United States and also influenced this style of cuisine to some extent.
 Most of these immigrants arrived in the United States during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and during this time, many Italians coming from  Naples  and  Sicily  moved to large American cities, such as  New York City ,  Boston ,  Philadelphia ,  Cleveland ,  Chicago ,  St. Louis ,  Los Angeles , and  San Francisco ; the immigrant cuisine is thus largely derived from  Neapolitan  and  Sicilian cuisine , and is particularly associated with these locations.
 Italian-Americans often identify foods with their regional heritage. Southern Italian staples include dry  pasta ,  tomato sauce , and  olive oil , whereas Northern Italian staples include foods such as  risotto ,  white sauce  and  polenta . [1] 
 Over time, through an increased appreciation of Italian cuisine in the United States, as well as increased imports into the United States from Italy, there has been a push towards producing more authentic dishes, which use techniques and ingredients that are more native to Italy.
 American cuisine has readily received innovations from Italy, such as  espresso  (which evolved into specialty coffee drinks, now ubiquitous in American life),  tiramisu , and  Nutella .
 On the other hand, e.g.  pasta alla carbonara , a dish unrecorded in Italy before  World War II , may be due to an American influence in relationship to the allied  liberation of Rome  in 1944. [2]  Many Italians then were happy to use powdered eggs and bacon supplied by the  United States  and their armed forces for pasta dishes. [3] 
 
 Popularity of Italian-American cuisine [ edit ] 
 Italian-American food and  Mediterranean cuisine  has been highly influential in the American diet. It is one of the top three cuisines in the United States, according to the  National Restaurant Association :
 
 Prof.  Donna Gabaccia  in " Italian Americana " Winter and Summer 1998 volumes, no. 1 & 2 states that "food and cooking are powerful expressions of our ties to the past and to our current identity".
"Italian, Mexican and Chinese ( Cantonese ) cuisines have joined the mainstream. These three cuisines have become so ingrained in the American culture that they are no longer foreign to the American palate. According to the  National Restaurant Association  study, more than nine out of 10 consumers are familiar with and have tried these foods, and about half report eating them frequently". [4] 
 Rated high on the list of popular, or trending, items in the survey include  Mediterranean   flatbread ,  ciabatta  bread,  espresso  and specialty coffee drinks. [5]   Pizza  and  pasta  are also common dishes in the United States; however, they are often presented in very different forms than in Italy.
 
 Italian-American cuisine and wine [ edit ] 
 There is a strong association between Italian-American cuisine with the history of  winemaking  in the United States.
 Many  Italian wines  were first introduced to the United States in the late 1700s. Italian vintners were first brought to the state of  Florida  in 1766 by  Dr. Andrew Turnbull , a British Consul at  Smyrna  (now  Izmir ).  Philip Mazzei , an Italian physician, and close friend of U.S. President  Thomas Jefferson , also helped to cultivate vineyards, olives, and other Mediterranean fruit with the help of Italians. [6] 
 In later years, American  viticulture  was more influenced by the Italian  diaspora  of the  transatlantic migrations , which steadily brought more Italians to America from the 1870s through the 1920s. Most of these Italians entered the East Coast of the United States through  Ellis Island , whereas many of those quickly passed through to the American West Coast, where California still had its famous " Gold Rush ".
 In California, Italian-Americans were inspired by the expanse of rolling hills and fertile fields. Prior to  Prohibition  starting in 1919, many wineries had made their start: Seghesio,  Simi ,  Sebastiani Vineyards  and Foppiano began in the late 19th century and remain in operation today. Others included Giuseppe Magliavacca's Napa winery, Secondo Guasti's Italian Vineyard Company and Andrea Sbarbaro's  Italian-Swiss Colony .
 From 1919 until the  repeal of Prohibition  in 1933, many Italian-Americans struggled to keep their vineyards going. Many remained through providing sacramental wine to the  Catholic Church  or grape juice to the general market. These few holdouts can be credited with salvaging America's viticulture heritage, in an industry that values the longevity and tradition of the vine and its produce. [7] 
 Today, Italian-American wineries prove a powerful asset on the world market. Some of these companies include:  Atlas Peak  (also known as  Antinori ),  Cosentino , Dalla Valle, [8]  Delicato, [9]  Ferrari-Carano, [10]   E & J Gallo Winery , Geyser Peak,  Louis M. Martini ,  Mazzocco ,  Robert Mondavi ,  Monte Bello Ridge ,  Corrado Parducci , Pedroncelli Winery, [11]  Robert Pepi, [12]   Picchetti Brothers Winery , Rochioli, [13]  Rafanelli, [14]   Rubicon Estate Winery  (also known as  Francis Ford Coppola Presents ),  Sebastiani Vineyards , Signorello, [15]   Sattui ,  Trinchero  (most often under the  Sutter Home  brand),  Valley of the Moon , Viansa, [16]  and more.
 
 Dishes [ edit ] 
 Pastas and grains [ edit ] 
 American chop suey —a distant relative of  ragù bolognese  made primarily with hamburger meat 
 Baked ziti —ziti pasta, originally from Sicily, tube-shaped pasta similar to penne but much longer, mixed with a tomato sauce and covered in cheese, then baked in the oven 
 Lasagna , particularly using  ricotta , called  lasagne alla napoletana  in Italy. The ricotta distinguishes it from the original and better-known (outside the U.S.) North Italian style that uses  béchamel sauce , called   lasagne alla bolognese  or just  lasagne 
 Penne alla vodka —the sauce of this pasta dish consists of tomato, onion, prosciutto, cream and vodka 
 Spaghetti and meatballs —a dish based on Neapolitan festival dishes involving much smaller meatballs as well as other ingredients, [17]  iconic in the United States. The dish as served in the United States is unknown in Italy. Meatballs ( polpette ) are not served on top of pasta in Italy. 
 Vegetable dishes [ edit ] 
 Eggplant parmesan  or  melanzane alla parmigiana  is a common Italian dish. It typically includes sliced eggplant,  marinara sauce , and cheese, layered repeatedly. It is never served on or with spaghetti in Italy and there are no meat "parmigianas" though zucchini- and artichoke-based versions do exist. 
 Peas and eggs or  piselli cacio e uova , originally a meal eaten by poor Italian immigrants has since become a favorite  lenten  meal. It consists of simply eggs and peas, fried in a pan with olive oil and some garlic, onion and pepper. 
 Meats and eggs [ edit ] 
 Frittata —An open-faced omelette containing meat, cheese, potatoes, peas, asparagus, peppers,  cucuzza  (i.e.,  squash ), onions, and other vegetables, alone or in combination. These can be eaten by themselves or on sandwiches. 
 Sausage and peppers — Salsiccia , peppers and onions cooked together, sometimes with a very light red sauce. 
 Porchetta , also known as "porketta," Italian roast pork, roast pork, roast pork sandwich, or Italian pulled pork depending on the region of the U.S. Roast pork butt or shoulder; often a full suckling pig. Traditionally a holiday or celebration dish or found at festivals or fairs. However, it is commonly eaten in a sandwich form, usually with  broccoli rabe , in  Philadelphia 's Italian-American communities and in recent times throughout the city. Brought to America mostly by immigrants from  Abruzzo , as well as those from  Lazio  (especially the  Alban Hills ),  Marche , and  Tuscany . 
 Chicken (or Veal) Parmesan —fried breaded chicken or veal cutlets covered in sauce and cheese, served with pasta. A very popular dish in casual dining restaurants, as well as a sandwich filling. The name of this dish is often abbreviated to "parm". 
 Chicken marsala —chicken cutlets, mushrooms, and Marsala wine. 
 Chicken Francese  was developed by Italian American restaurateurs after the  Second World War , when French food became popular after GIs returning from France had developed a taste for it. [18] 
 Sauces [ edit ] 
 Alfredo sauce —derived from the Fettuccine Alfredo made popular by Roman restaurateur Alfredo di Lelio [19]  starting in 1914. American Alfredo sauce consists largely of cream, butter, and  Parmigiano-Reggiano  cheese with nutmeg and black pepper seasonings, and is served over vegetables and some meats (particularly chicken and shellfish) as well as the signature pasta ribbons. The authentic Alfredo dish only consists of  fettuccine  pasta, butter and parmigiano reggiano. The primary difference between authentic fettuccine Alfredo and Alfredo sauce is that while the pasta dish is prepared by adding ingredients to the cooked pasta, Alfredo sauce is prepared in bulk and poured over pasta or other ingredients (vegetables such as  broccoli  and meats such as shrimp or grilled chicken are common additions). Though very popular in the United States, this sauce is virtually unheard of in Italy. [20] 
 Marinara sauce —a quick-cooking, sometimes spicy tomato sauce without meat served on pasta.  Salsa al pomodoro  is the usual Italian name. 
 Bolognese sauce —a meat-based sauce originating from  Bologna , Italy. 
 Sunday  sauce —a meat-infused  tomato sauce  commonly made on Sundays and special occasions; derived from the Italian  ragù napoletano . In some areas, including  Boston ,  New Jersey , and  Philadelphia , it is sometimes called "gravy". 
 Seafood dishes [ edit ] 
 Lobster  Fra Diavolo —a pasta dish made with lobster, sometimes other seafood, that contains crushed red pepper to make it spicy. 
 Baccalà — salt cod fish , traditionally served during  Lent  or for  Christmas Eve . Can be fried,  baccalà  salad, so on. 
 Alici  or  Acciughe— another integral dish served during Christmas Eve's  Feast of the Seven Fishes . This dish's full name is  spaghetti con aglio, olio e acciughe  (spaghetti with garlic, oil, and anchovies;  alici  is another word for anchovy). The anchovies and garlic are sliced very thin and dissolve in the oil. When served, the dish appears to be just pasta covered in hot oil. (Many variants exist in Italy: some don't have anchovies, some add  capers  or  chili pepper .) 
 Soups and stews [ edit ] 
 Cioppino —a fish stew characteristic of West Coast Italian American cookery, particularly  San Francisco . 
 Wedding soup —a soup with meatballs or sausage and pasta in a chicken broth. 
 Pasta e fagioli  (or "pasta fazool" in Italian-American slang, from Southern Italian  fasule  ("beans") instead of standard Italian  fagioli )—pasta with beans, often  cannellini beans , that has the consistency of a stew. 
 Breads, sandwiches, and savory baked goods [ edit ]

   New York-style pizza , at  Di Fara Pizza 
   Chicago-style pizza 
 Calzone  and  stromboli —while the half-moon shaped Italian calzone is well known in the United States, the very similar tube-shaped stromboli as well as large, loaf-like calzones served in slices are also fairly common. 
 Italian  bread —Perhaps a bit closer to  French bread  in composition and appearance, American "Italian bread" is a lean white bread, often braided and covered in  sesame seeds , with a thin but usually crisp crust and a soft crumb. American "Italian bread" does not particularly resemble many traditional Italian bread forms, but is very popular in both loaf form and roll form, where it is often closely associated with sandwich making. A regional variety of this is  Scali . 
 Pizza —the most common form of American pizza is based on (and called) the  Neapolitan style , the earliest and essentially standard version of which is commonly called  New York-style . Also popular in America is a version of the  Sicilian pizza , a larger square pizza in which the dough is risen an inch or more, and which is topped (contrary to native Sicilian tradition) in much the same way as the thin-crusted round Neapolitan form, including the use of  mozzarella . Even more Americanized forms such as  Greek pizza ,  apizza  (i.e.  New Haven-style pizza ) and  Chicago-style  have become common. 
 Submarine sandwich —originated in several different Italian American communities in the Northeastern United States from the late 19th to mid-20th centuries. 
 Muffuletta —a large sandwich with  cold cuts  and  olive salad , made on a round loaf; originated in  New Orleans . 
 Italian beef  sandwich—a type of roast beef sandwich native to  Chicago , similar to a  French dip sandwich . 
 Italian sandwich 
 Meatball sandwich 
 Pizzagaina ,   pizza ghen  or  pizza rustica —Easter pie, made with various cheeses, eggs, and salted meats. Compare  torta pasqualina  [ it ] , from Liguria, or the Italian-Argentine version,  torta pascualina . [21]   Pizzagaina  may also be called  pasteed  or  pastiere , although it is more of a quiche than pie unlike  pizzagaina. [22] 
 Sweets [ edit ] 
 Tiramisu —a sweet multi-layered cake with a light fluffy cream, often served with a coffee or other hot caffeinated beverage. Tiramisu is one of the more recent Italian imports, having been invented after World War II (probably in the Veneto region), but adopted readily by American diners. 
 Cannoli —a sweet  ricotta  filling in a fried pastry shell. 
 Struffoli  (or Struf')— Fried dough  for dessert. Christmas cake typical of  Naples . In  Abruzzo , this dish is called  cicerchiata , meaning "blue sweet-pea dish" and is eaten before Easter. 
 Biscotti d'annodare— knot cookies. 
 Sfogliatelle —a sort of custard turnover made with leaved ( millefoglie ) pastry; a similar pastry, larger and filled with a type of  pastry cream , is sometimes called a " lobster  tail". 
 Biscotti —generally anise flavored, often nut-studded hard cookie that may alternatively contain dried fruit or chocolate are common as well; often dipped in coffee rather than sweet dessert wines as in Italy. American biscotti are almost always loaf-type cookies that are sliced and rebaked to crispness, while the term refers to almost all forms of  cookie  in Italy. 
 Pizzelle —traditional  Italian   waffle   cookies  made from flour, eggs, sugar, butter or oil, and flavoring (usually  anise  or  anisette , less commonly  vanilla  or  lemon zest ). Originally from  Abruzzo , brought over to the United States by Abruzzese immigrants. Popular during  Christmas  in the Northeastern United States among Italian-Americans and especially in  Philadelphia  and other cities where large numbers of Abruzzese immigrants settled. [23] [24]
