 Mordovian cuisine  is the traditional cuisine of the  Mordovians , who now live in  Mordovia  and surrounding areas. It consists of a variety of dishes, based on geographical, cultural and climate features of the region, with fish traditionally featured heavily. [1] 
 
 
 Fish [ edit ] 
 Volga Finns  settled on the riversides, in places convenient for fishing. [2]  Traditionally Mordvians pay a great attention to the support of nature. [2]  Fish dishes varied by the type of cooking; fish was eaten raw, frozen, dried, salty, and boiled. [2]  Fish liver, fish eggs, milt, cod-liver oil were used as cooking ingredients. [2] 
 
 Meat [ edit ] 
 Meat and poultry was stewed, baked and boiled. [1]  There were no fried meat dishes in Finnic cuisine, only roasted dishes which also were borrowed from  Tatar  cuisine in the 19th century. [2]  Beef, mutton and pork were preserved in several ways. [2] [3]  The most ancient preservation method was drying. [2] [3]  Pre-boiled meat was dried in an oven or under the sun. [2] [3]  Fat from broth was collected and used for cooking. Meat was also frozen for preservation. [2] [3] 
 In ancient times,  horsemeat  was used for food, but later it was used only in rituals ( molyam ) associated with  horse worship . [2] 
 
 Herbs and vegetables [ edit ] 
 Many farms grew  cabbage ,  cucumbers ,  potatoes ,  garlic ,  carrots ,  beans ,  beets ,  turnips ,  radishes , and  pumpkins . [2]  In summer and autumn, a great deal of fruit were eaten fresh. [2]  Pickled cucumbers were used for preparing dishes. [ citation needed ]  Beets and pumpkins were eaten steamed as a dessert. [2]   Shschi  (cabbage soup) was a traditional soup consisting of cabbage and potatoes cooked in chicken broth with onions and carrots added at the end. [4]  Herbs such as  watercress ,  horseradish ,  onion ,  cow parsnip ,  horsetail ,  nettle , and wild  goutweed  were used for preparing dishes instead of spices. [2] 
 
 Mushrooms [ edit ] 
 Mushrooms  were one of the main ingredients in traditional dishes. They were boiled, salted, fried, soured and dried. [2] 
 
 Grains [ edit ] 
 Grains had a special place in Mordovian cuisine. [1]   Finnic peoples  mostly used wheat, barley, spelt and rye (black cereal). [1] [2]  Ritual meals in Mordovia were associated with agricultural period, family and public holidays. [2]  For example, millet porridge was not only a delicious meal on weddings. christenings, funerals, but also there was a special ritual  baba's porridge  (female porridge) made at the last day of a bride at home. [2] 
 
 Bliny (pancakes) [ edit ] 
   Blinys 
 Bliny ( pancakes ) [5]  were a favorite dish of Mordovians. [1] [2]  They were called  pachat  and were made from rye, wheat, millet and pea flour. [2]  Traditionally Mordovians liked the pancakes to be rather thick and added boiled potatoes into the dough. [2]  Such pancakes were served with milk and honey. [2]
