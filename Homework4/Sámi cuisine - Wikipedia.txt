 Cuisine of peoples from the Sápmi territory of the Sámi people 
   Sámi milking bowls 
 Sámi cuisine  is the cuisine of peoples from the  Sápmi  territory of the  Sámi people , which spans  Norway ,  Sweden ,  Finland  and  Russia . Its traditional  cuisine  of each area has individual traits.
 
 
 Staple food [ edit ] 
   Dried  reindeer  meat 
 Traditionally, the cuisine of Sápmi has been based on local materials, like  fish ,  game ,  reindeer  and  berries . [1]   Berries  have been important food, because other kinds of fruits or vegetables were not available during the long winters. Nowadays berries are parts of delicate sauces and desserts. The most valued berry of Sápmi is the  cloudberry .  Milk  consumption varied among groups of Sámi, but was not very common in general. [2] 
 In eastern parts of Sápmi,  reindeer herding  became a way of life in the 19th century and, before that, people were  hunters  and  fishers . These days reindeer is essential for Sámi cuisine, but game, fish and wild birds are also important. The cuisine of  Sápmi  consists of a variety of dishes which stem from differences in geography, culture and climate.
 
 Meat dishes [ edit ] 
 Reindeer,  fish  and game meats are  staple foods , [3]  with thousands of recipes and flavors, although spices other than salt are very rare. The local cuisine varies a lot, depending on access to food. Sápmi's history with its many cultural influences has led to an array of dishes. Most dishes are made of reindeer meat, although some also are made of moose or sheep.  Smoking  and  drying  have historically been used to preserve meat and fish.
 
 Fish dishes [ edit ] 
 Fishes in the mountains and forest areas of Sápmi include  Salmon ,  Common whitefish ,  Perch ,  Roach , and  Char . Fishes of the coastal areas of Sápmi include  Cod . [ citation needed ] 
 
 New cooking [ edit ] 
 In the last decades new influences have been introduced in traditional Sámi cooking. A well-known dish of this cross-cooking is the Suovaskebab, which consists of sliced suovasbierggo, cucumber, salad and garlic dressing in a  pita  bread. The Suovaskebab can be found at festivals and fairs in northern Scandinavia. These days the old food culture is evolving and adapting.  Fast food  restaurants in Sápmi can have reindeer hamburger on their menus. [ citation needed ]
