 Cookbook: Cuisine of Pakistan

 Mughlai cuisine  consists of dishes developed in the  medieval   Indo-Persian cultural  centres of the  Mughal Empire . It represents a combination of  cuisine of the Indian subcontinent  with the cooking styles and recipes of  Central Asian  and  Islamic cuisine . Mughlai cuisine is strongly influenced by the  Turkic  cuisine of  Central Asia , the region where the early  Mughal emperors  originally hailed from, and it has in turn strongly influenced the regional cuisines of  Northern India ,  Pakistan  and  Bangladesh .
 The tastes of Mughlai cuisine vary from extremely mild to spicy, and are often associated with a distinctive  aroma  and the taste of ground and whole spices. [1]  A Mughlai course is an elaborate  buffet  of main course dishes with a variety of  accompaniments . [2] 
 
 
 History [ edit ] 
 Although the ruling class and administrative elite of the Mughal Empire could variously identify themselves as  Turani  ( Turkic ),  Irani  ( Persian ),  Shaikhzada  ( Indian Muslim ) and  Hindu Rajput , the empire itself was  Indo-Persian , having a hybridized, pluralistic  Persianate  culture. Decorated Indo-Persian cookbooks and culinary manuscripts adorned the personal libraries of the Mughal elite, serving as both culinary guides and for aesthetic value. [3] 
 One example was the  Ni'matnama , a 15th-century work illustrated with Persian miniatures. This was commissioned by Sultan Ghiyas Shah, a sultan of  Malwa  in modern-day  Madhya Pradesh , and features  Central Asian  dishes such as  samosas  (fried meat-filled pastry),  khichri  (rice and lentils),  pilaf  (rice dish),  seekh  (skewered meat and fish),  kabab  (skewered, roasted meat) and  yakhni  ( meat broth ),  as well as western and southern Indian dishes, such as  karhi  (yogurt broth mixed with chickpea flour),  piccha  and  khandvi. 
 From the Mughal period itself, one popular culinary work was the  Nuskha-i-Shahjahani,  a record of the dishes believed to be prepared for the court of Emperor Shahjahan (r.1627-1658). This Persian manuscript features ten chapters, on  nānhā  (breads),  āsh-hā  (pottages),  qalīyas  and  dopiyāzas  (dressed meat dishes),  bhartas ,  zerbiryāns  (a kind of layered rice-based dish),  pulāʾo ,  kabābs ,  harīsas  (savoury porridge),  shishrangas  and  ḵẖāgīnas  (omelette), and  khichṛī;  the final chapter involves  murabbā  (jams),  achār  (pickles),  pūrī  (fried bread),  fhīrīnī  (sweets),  ḥalwā  (warm pudding), and basic recipes for the preparation of  yoghurt ,  panīr  (Indian curd cheese) and the coloring of butter and dough. [4] 
 
Another famous textbook was  Ḵẖulāṣat-i Mākūlāt u Mashrūbāt,  perhaps dating to the era of the emperor  Aurangzeb  (r. 1656–1707), while another was  Alwān-i Niʿmat,  a work dedicated solely to sweetmeats. Divya Narayanan writes: These include varieties of sweet breads such as  nān ḵẖatā̤ʾī  (crisp bread, like a biscuit), sweet  pūrīs , sweet  samosas  (or  saṃbosas ),  laḍḍū  and  ḥalwā . The cookbook introduces each recipe with a line of praise: for instance  saṃbosa-i yak tuhī dam dāda  ( samosa  with a pocket cooked on  dam ) is declared as being ‘among the famous and well-known sweets;  pūrī dam dāda bādāmī  (almond  pūrīs  cooked on  dam ) is said to be ‘among the delicious and excellent sweetmeats, and  nān ḵẖatā̤ʾī bādāmī  (almond  nān ḵẖatā̤ʾī ) is noted for being ‘among the rare and delicious recipes. [5] There are even many commonalities between Indo-Persian cookbooks used at the Mughal court and contemporary culinary works from  Safavid Iran , such as the  Kārnāma dar bāb-i T̤abāḵẖī wa ṣanʿat-i ān  (Manual on Dishes and their Preparation) of Ḥājī Muḥammad ʿAlī Bāwarchī Bag̱ẖdādī.
 Mughlai cuisine is renowned for the richness and aromaticity of the meals due to extensive use of spices like saffron, cardamom, black pepper, dry fruits and nuts, as well as rich cream, milk and butter in preparation of curry bases. This has influenced the development of North Indian cuisine. [6]
