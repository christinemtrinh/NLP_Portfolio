   Jollof rice  with vegetables and a boiled egg 
 Cuisine in Mali  includes  rice  and  millet  as staples of  Mali , a food culture heavily based on  cereal grains . [1] [2]  Grains are generally prepared with sauces made from edible leaves, such as  spinach ,  sweet potato  or  baobab , with  tomato   peanut  sauce. The dishes may be accompanied by pieces of grilled  meat  (typically  chicken ,  mutton ,  beef , or  goat ). [1] [2] 
 Malian cuisine varies regionally. [1] [2]  Part of  West African cuisine , other popular dishes in Mali include  fufu ,  Jollof rice , and  maafe  (peanut butter sauce).
