 Moroccan cuisine  ( Arabic :  المطبخ المغربي ) is the cuisine of  Morocco , [ citation needed ]   fueled by interactions and exchanges with many cultures and nations over the centuries. [1]  Moroccan cuisine is usually a mix of  Arab ,  Berber ,  Andalusi , and  Mediterranean  cuisines, with minimal  European  (French and Spanish) and sub-Saharan influences. [2]  Like the rest of the  Maghrebi cuisine , Moroccan cuisine has more in common with  Middle Eastern cuisine  than with the rest of  Africa . [3] 
 According to Moroccan chef and cuisine researcher Hossin Houari, the oldest traces of Moroccan cuisine that can still be observed today, go back to the  7th century BC . [4] 
 
 
 Ingredients [ edit ] 
 Morocco produces a large range of Mediterranean fruits and vegetables, as well as tropical products like snails. Common meats include  beef ,  goat ,  mutton and lamb , which, together with  chicken  and  seafood , serve as a base for the cuisine. Characteristic flavorings include  lemon pickle ,  argan oil , preserved butter ( smen ),  olive oil , and dried fruits.
 The staple grains today are rice and wheat, used for bread and couscous, though until the mid-20th century,  barley  was an important staple, especially in the south. [5]  Grapes are mostly eaten fresh, as a dessert; wine consumption is only about 1 liter per capita per year. [6] [7] [8]  The traditional cooking fats are butter and animal fat, though olive oil is now replacing them. [9]  Butter is used both fresh,  zebeda , and preserved,  smen . [10] 
 
 Flavorings [ edit ] 
 Spices  and  Ras el hanout  are used extensively in Moroccan food. [11] [12] [13]  Although some spices have been imported to Morocco through the  Arabs , introducing  Persian  and  Arabic  cooking influences, many ingredients—like  saffron  from Talaouine, mint and olives from  Meknes , and oranges and lemons from  Fes —are home-grown, and are being exported. After the  Idrissids  established  Fes  in 789, predominant in  Arab culture , many spices were brought from the east. [14]  Common spices include  cinnamon ,  cumin ,  turmeric ,  ginger ,  paprika ,  coriander ,  saffron ,  mace ,  cloves ,  fennel ,  anise ,  nutmeg ,  cayenne pepper ,  fenugreek ,  caraway ,  black pepper  and  sesame seeds . Twenty-seven spices are combined for the Moroccan spice mixture  ras el hanout . [15] 
 Common herbs in Moroccan cuisine include  mint ,  parsley ,  coriander ,  oregano ,  peppermint ,  marjoram ,  verbena ,  sage  and  bay laurel .
 
 Structure of meals [ edit ] 
   Khudenjal , an herbal tea based on  Alpinia officinarum ,  and two types of  sellou  at  Jemaa el-Fnaa  in Marrakesh. 
 A typical lunch begins with a series of hot and cold salads, followed by a  tagine  or  dwaz . Often, for a formal meal, a lamb or chicken dish is next, or couscous topped with meat and vegetables. Traditionally, Moroccans eat with their hands and use bread. [16]  The consumption of pork and alcohol is uncommon due to  religious restrictions . [17] 
 
 Main dishes [ edit ] 
 See also:  List of Moroccan dishes 
   Couscous  with vegetables, meat, and  tfaya , a confection of caramelized onions, raisins, sugar, butter, and cinnamon. 
 The main Moroccan dish people are most familiar with is  couscous ; [18]   lamb  is the most commonly eaten meat in Morocco, usually eaten in a  tagine  with a wide selection of vegetables. Chicken is also very commonly used in  tagines  or roasted. They also use additional ingredients such as plums, boiled eggs, and lemon. Like their national food, the  tagine  has a unique taste of popular spices such as saffron, cumin, cinnamon, ginger, and cilantro, as well as ground red pepper. [19] 
 Moroccan cuisine has ample seafood dishes.  European pilchard  is caught in large but declining quantities. [20]  Other fish species include  mackerel ,  anchovy ,  sardinella , and  horse mackerel . [21] 
 Other famous Moroccan dishes are  pastilla  (also spelled  basteeya  or  bestilla ),  tanjia , and  rfissa .
 
   Tagine  cooked chicken and vegetables with  mint tea  and  khobz el-dâr . 
 A big part of the daily meal is bread. Bread in Morocco is principally made from durum wheat semolina known as  khobz . Bakeries are very common throughout Morocco and fresh bread is a staple in every city, town, and village. The most common is whole-grain coarse ground or white-flour bread or baguettes. There are also a number of flat breads and pulled unleavened pan-fried breads.
 In addition, there are dried salted meats and salted preserved meats such as  khlea [22]  and  g'did  (basically  sheep   bacon ), which are used to flavor  tagines  or used in  el rghaif , a folded savory Moroccan pancake.
 
 Soups [ edit ] 
 Harira , a typical heavy  soup , eaten during winter to warm up and is usually served for dinner. It is typically eaten with plain bread or with  dates  during the month of  Ramadan .  Bissara  is a  broad bean -based soup that is also consumed during the colder months of the year. [23] 
 
 Salads [ edit ] 
   Salad asorti , served in Beni Mellal Salads  include both raw and cooked vegetables, served either hot or cold. [24]  include  zaalouk ,  an  aubergine  and  tomato  mixture, and  taktouka  (a mixture of tomatoes, smoked green peppers, garlic, and spices) characteristic of the cities of Taza and Fes, in the Atlas. [24]  Another cold salad is called  bakoula , or  khoubiza , consisting of braised mallow leaves, but can also be made with spinach or arugula, with parsley, cilantro, lemon, olive oil, and olives.
 Desserts [ edit ] 
 Usually, seasonal fruits rather than cooked desserts are served at the close of a meal. A common dessert is  kaab el ghzal  ( كعب الغزال ,  gazelle ankles ), a pastry stuffed with  almond paste  and topped with sugar. Another is  halwa  chebakia , pretzel-shaped dough deep-fried, soaked in honey and sprinkled with sesame seeds; it is eaten during the month of  Ramadan .  Jowhara  is a delicacy typical of Fes, made with fried  waraq  pastry, cream, and toasted almond slices. [25]  Coconut fudge cakes, 'Zucre Coco', are popular also.
 
 Seafood [ edit ] 
 See also:  Fishing industry in Morocco 
 Morocco is endowed with over 3000 km of coastline. There is an abundance of fish in these coastal waters with the  sardine  being commercially significant as Morocco is the world's largest exporter. [26]  Sardines were used in the production of  garum  in  Lixus .
 At Moroccan fish markets one can find  sole ,  swordfish ,  tuna ,  turbot ,  mackerel ,  shrimp ,  conger eel ,  skate ,  red snapper ,  spider crab ,  lobster  and a variety of  mollusks .
 In Moroccan cuisine, seafood is incorporated into, among others,  tajines ,  bastilla ,  briouat , and  paella .

 Drinks [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Moroccan tea culture 
   Moroccan mint tea 
   A pistachio croissant served with a  nuṣṣ-nuṣṣ  ( نص-نص  "half-half," a Moroccan variant of  café crème ), served at a café in Casablanca. 
 The most popular drink is  Moroccan mint tea , locally called  atay . Traditionally, making good mint tea in Morocco is considered an art form and the drinking of it with friends and family is often a daily tradition. The pouring technique is as crucial as the quality of the tea itself. Moroccan tea pots have long, curved pouring spouts and this allows the tea to be poured evenly into tiny glasses from a height. For the best taste, glasses are filled in two stages. The Moroccans traditionally like tea with bubbles, so while pouring they hold the teapot high above the glasses. Finally, the tea is accompanied with hard sugar cones or lumps. [27]  Morocco has an abundance of oranges and tangerines, so fresh orange juice is easily found and inexpensive.
 
 Snacks and fast food [ edit ] 
 Selling  fast food  in the street has long been a tradition, and the best example is  Djemaa el Fna square  in  Marrakech .  Ma'quda  is a potato fritter popular among students and people of modest means, particularly in  Fes . [28]  Starting in the 1980s, new snack restaurants, primarily in the north, started serving  bocadillos  (a  Spanish  word for a  sandwich ).
 Dairy product  shops locally called  mhlaba  ( محْلَبة ), are very prevalent all around the country. Those dairy stores generally offer all types of  dairy products ,  juices ,  smoothies , and local fare such as bocadillos,  msemmen  and  harcha . [29] 
 The  khanz u-bnīn  ( خانز وبنين  "stinky and delicious") is a cheap and popular street sandwich. [30] 
 Another popular street food in Morocco is  snails , served in their juices in small bowls, and eaten using a toothpick. [31] 
 In the late 1990s, several multinational fast-food  franchises  opened restaurants in major cities. [32] 
 
 Chefs [ edit ] 
 Among those who have brought Moroccan cuisine to a wider audience are TV chef Choumicha and  Al-Amīn al-Hajj Mustafa an-Nakīr , chef to the former king of Morocco  Hassan II .
