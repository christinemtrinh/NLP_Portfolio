 Sylheti cuisine  ( Sylheti :  ꠍꠤꠟꠐꠤ ꠞꠣꠘꠗꠣꠛꠣꠠꠣ ) represents the food culture of  Sylhetis .  Hatkora  is a common fruit and used to cook different dishes with fish and meat. Enriched with  Vitamin C  and  antioxidants , hatkora curry is best eaten with rice. [1]  Though Sylhetis are mainly rice and fish eaters, their culinary system is distinctly different to non-Sylhetis. [2]  Multicultural people of  Barak Valley  to  Surma valley , [3]  and the Sylheti diaspora have influenced the Sylheti food and flavours practiced for ages. Among them, the culinary system of  Khasi ,  Kuki  and other tribes are noteworthy. [4]  The cuisine of Sylhet has grown up depending on the availability of plants and animals in the region. Mainly indigenous with some variety, food culture is performed among the Sylhetis that received some external influences as well. When the 360 disciples of  Shah Jalal  arrived in this region, they not only brought their distinct cultures but also brought distinct cooking styles of their own. [5]  Which included many meat dishes along with chicken, beef and goat cooked Mughlai, Middle-Eastern, and Northern Indian style.  Mughlai Porota ,  Pilau ,  Korma , Kalia, Roast,  Biriyani  and  Kofta  for curry dishes while  Zardah ,  Firni  and  Kheer  for  desserts  have been also included. [ citation needed ] 
 It is said that  Syed Tufuzzul Ali , a Sylheti who opened the first  Indian food  shop on  Victoria Dock Road  in London. [6]  Later, in the 1940s some entrepreneurial Sylhetis began setting up cafés and introduced  curry and rice  to the menu. But lack of confidence saw the  Bangladeshis  refer to their food as  Indian . [7]  In the United Kingdom, more than 8 out of 10 Indian restaurants are owned by Bangladeshis, [8]  95% of which come from Sylhet. [9]  Sylhet is not known for its cuisine, though 80% to 90% British curry-house trace their roots directly to  Sylhet . [10] [11]  Chefs from Sylhet region developed the  British curry  to a greater extent since the 1960s. [12]   Chicken tikka masala , invented by the Sylhetis is regarded as Britain's  National dish  since 2001, by Britain's foreign secretary  Robin Cook . [13] [14]  The birthday celebration of the  British Prime Minister   Tony Blair 's daughter at a  Bangladeshi restaurant  proves the popularity of Sylheti cuisine. [15]  Historian  Lizzie Collingham , in her 2005 book  Curry: A Biography , coined that the  Sylheti curry cooks converted “unadventurous British palates” to a new flavour spectrum . [16]
